# How To Run A Design Sprint In An Afternoon
## 90 minutes of intense group collaboration with only paper

Note: an earlier version of this article was originally published on the Zapier company blog. I’ve made some minor edits and elaborated a few areas in this newer piece.

At an annual team retreat in Colorado, I led the Zapier team through a quick brainstorming exercise and I’m here to explain how it works, as well as why it’s an effective tool for any fast-paced team. 

Whether it’s called a design studio or visual brainstorming, I haven’t seen it discussed much online and that’s a shame, since it’s a bit of a hidden gem in my designer’s toolkit. It’s a super unique technique and an organized method for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions bursting with ideas for features to flesh out and design variations to explore.

One of the reasons I love it so much is that the types of high-pressure environments I’ve worked in don’t have the kind of time to take off a week or more from feature work to do the kind of design sprint popularized by GV and their book. Yet at the same time, those are exactly the kind of situations that need it the most, otherwise the frantic pace of feature development often runs into avoidable pot holes and cul de sacs.

So this mini sprint format I’ve used for sketching and prototyping session is the perfect format for teams in the real world, one they can make time for while still getting many of the benefits of a week-long design sprint: iliciting massively parallel feedback from every team member in a visual way that can actually be absorbed by everyone, especially designers outnumbered by a much larger team of engineers, sales, customer support, and various other stakeholders.

I first ran a design studio a few years back at a workshop I organized called Toolbox and then also ran a few design meetups while my company did Y Combinator’s Summer 2012 session. It was a great way to validate potential designs in a fast-paced environment and I thought the timing was right for Zapier to do a session as well.

## — Format —

Enough hype - what’s the format and how do you run it?

On a Sunday afternoon, I acted as moderator and fired up a short Keynote presentation to explain the overall goals and format of the design session. I listed a handful of topics that had been floating around as potential projects and we voted for the top three that we thought were most immediately relevant to our company goals.

Then, our 10 person company split into three sub-teams to tackle each of the projects. From there, we went into a highly structured session of sketching and brainstorming.

We did three rounds of activity. Each round was 10 minutes long, with 5 minutes of sketching designs on the pads and 5 minutes of discussion.

Here’s the really important bit: every round has a different format of sketching and with silent reflective time built in between sessions, in order to stimulate individual thought and avoid groupthink.

### 1st Round: silent sketching
* The focus of this round is divergence — come up with many different approaches.

Every person sketched silently by themselves, without talking to anyone, to get out their initial ideas. To help them come up with several concepts and not get locked into a single approach, I had everyone do what’s called a six-up by dividing their first paper into six evenly-sized boxes, which they had to try to fill up with as many different concepts as possible.

Then at the end of the 5 minutes, each subteam got 5 minutes total for each member to take a minute to describe the various ideas they had.

The focus of this round is divergence—to come up with as many different approaches as possible. Three team members all drawing six thumbnail sketches each pretty much insured that there would be at least a few surprise curveball ideas.

### 2nd Round: incorporate feedback
* Switch from divergence to convergence - stop brainstorming and start picking the best ideas to iterate on.

Everyone went back to 5 minutes of sketching alone without talking again, but this time with new instructions: they were required to steal at least one idea from one of their team members that they had just heard about.

Then the subteams got another 5 minutes for everyone to share their work. The focus of this round was to begin to switch from divergence to convergence - to start picking the best ideas from the crop and evolving them.

In practice, the ideas are firing rapidly and it’s hard to get people to shut up at the end of the 5 minutes to move on to the next round. That’s a good sign! It means the ideas are flowing.

### 3rd round: group brainstorming & design decisions
* Make collaborative design decisions.

For the final round of sketching, the sub-teams now had a new task. Instead of sketching individually without talking, they had to do the exact opposite: now they had to sketch a single set of interfaces as a group and talk their way into consensus.

Then the sub-teams all presented to the other sub-teams and got insights into the different projects everyone was working on.

## — Results —
We found that people naturally and organically gravitated towards the sub-teams where they had been thinking about the most. For example our support team had a lot of thoughts to share about our onboarding process, the developers clustered together to talk about the platform for third-party integrations, and our marketing folks tackled app discovery and exploration.

So it ended up that there was at least one person on each sub-team that will be involved in implementing ideas on the related project.

Our team members seem to really like it, too. “It was a fast and effective way to braindump a ton of information pretty quickly and also reach a broad consensus at the same time,” said our CEO, Wade Foster.


## — Benefits —
Going a bit deeper on why this technique works so well compared to the usual Sharpie battles on a whiteboard, a paper sketching session can:

* **Create divergent ideas and convergent decisions** - i.e. idea generation vs synthesis. This new technique would have to both come up with a variety of ideas as well as organize them without spinning off into useless orbits, which can seem like opposing goals.
* **Balance individual contribution with group insights** - The technique is an automatic failure if it’s no better than just thinking about a problem by yourself, which only encourages silos of activity that might be hard to integrate later on.
* **Quickly express visual ideas** - It must be visual so that it’s not a boring functional spec that creates an illusion of agreement, and it has to be done rapidly so that ideas can be expressed fast enough to evolve them in a loose conversational manner.
* **Be extremely multi-threaded** - It would be ideal to crank through ideas for several projects simultaneously, rather than walking through each concept linearly.
* **Be easily archived** - Using paper instead of whiteboards makes it ideal for flipping back through past ideas, instead of being stuck on a single drawing.
* **Be actually fun** - There’s a reason why everyone feels comfortable grabbing sharpies and drawing rough sketches, so anything to replace it has to be equally approachable and engaging. It also has to be something everyone can do and doesn’t require the skills of a designer to visualize the hard parts.

So that’s how you run a design studio! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments if you want to run one with your team.
