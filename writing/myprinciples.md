# My Work Philosophy

"Great artists imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil."
- W. H. Davenport Adams, writing about the poet Alfred Tennyson

I've become a pretty good thief over the years. It's a subtle art to steal inspiration from various sources and then hide the heist, carefully melding the disparate pieces together to form a unique new thing.

What I've ended up with is not a single design style or process, but instead a constantly-evolving set of guiding principles and common work patterns.

Basically I try to think independently and do good work, fast. And play nicely with others. 

That's about it. Everything else is details.

The main tenets of my personal playbook are:

* Be flexible. Know your toolbox inside and out, so you can use the right tools at the right time, no matter what the team's development process is.
* Be fast. Momentum is king. Bring a positive and proactive energy to the team.
* Collaborate well but also think independently. Ingest many viewpoints while still creating opinionated work.
* Above all, do good work. The final product is the most important thing, all the way down to the smallest detail.

With all of my emphasis on speed, collaboration, independence and most of all, high quality end results, I guess you could say that these are my version of Dieter Rams' principles of good design, especially at startups and fast-paced teams.

## Be Flexible

Specialization is for insects.
 - Robert A. Heinlein

The multifaceted nature of my profession is a perfect fit for my personality because I've always tried to be a master of several trades. Day-to-day, putting those core values to work can take shape in all kinds of different ways:

* Trawling through support requests to understand customer needs.
* Interviewing stakeholders to distill business goals.
* Doing competitive analysis.
* Making prototypes to test solutions.
* Prioritizing feature work.

And doing countless other things, without having to stop for guidance at every step.

To me, product design is a game for fullstack players. UX, UI, prototyping, frontend development, project management, business strategy... you have to play many positions to win at this game.

"UX is like Jazz. You need to be an expert musician and understand all the rules before you can break them.

Product design is like punk. You need three chords and a "can do" attitude. Screw the rules (and screw jazz)."
- Andy Budd

## Be Fast

It's important to attack the work with energy because none of the rest matters if you can't pull it all together in fun and positive way.

"Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier." 
 - It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership, by Colin Powell

Enthusiasm for the team and mission can't be faked, so I'm very picky about where I ply my trade. It's why I always advise junior designers: do the kind of work that you want to do more of and the rest will follow.

## Group Collaboration

There's no doubt that creating products is a team effort. Having good relationships and clear communication is particularly important to my style of work, since I have an almost journalistic approach and try to ingest as many different viewpoints as I can.

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
 - African proverb

Something about double diamond? There's a rhythm to group vs solo work. It's not easy to ingest as many viewpoints as possible, yet still create opinionated work.

Know when it's the right time to zoom out to collaborate and zoom in to execute.

Collaborate in ways that respect everyone else's time. (needs better rewording) Keep up team momentum. Work 1-on–1 with various roles and bring the entire team together only in short bursts.

## Independent Thought

Balancing collaborative skills with independent thought and proactive work is where the magic happens.

It's a particularly important skill for designers to be able to think for themselves because they're usually outnumbered by other roles, often by vast amounts. It's not uncommon for teams to have ratios as high as one designer per twenty developers, plus an assortment of PM's, stakeholders, marketers, and others.

The stakes are high - a designer's work sets the bar for expected product quality for everyone else. Good design work has an ineffable aspect that sets the tone and injects enthusiasm across all levels of a team. People want to bring good work to life when they're excited about the final product.

Creating work of a high caliber takes a little bit of solitude, a bit of space where independent critical thinking skills can thrive. Otherwise, you're purely reactive and so busy putting out various fires that standards drop just to keep up. Quantity wins over quality and the final product suffers.

So avoid groupthink. Think independently and initiate, don't just wait and react. Don't shirk hard decisions for the sake of consensus, or you'll be in a design-by-committee situation and only make Frankenstein designs.

Don't just take my word for it, look at the science! Groupthink is a common team dynamic and the results are usually inferior to solitary thought by individuals:

"Decades of research have consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas."
 - Groupthink: The brainstorming myth, New Yorker, Jan 30, 2012

So collaboration is great and all -don't be an asshole because your performance doesn't count if you don't play well with others - but designers aren't hired just to make sure everyone gets along no matter how bad the end result. You're there to make great products.

That means you need to be comfortable with thinking on your own, initiating your own product direction, and speaking up with candor.

## Further Reading

I've written an article called Structured Sketching about one of my favorite techniques for group brainstorming, and also a long form critique on the week-long exercise known as design sprints.

Shout out to Nathan Konty for clearly articulating a design approach that I'd been trying to describe for years:

CUTTING ROOM FLOOR

************************

My approach is bespoke and I don't have a "one size fits all" process for all projects. That said, I do have a few common themes throughout my work and I've distilled a handful of them here.

That's my take on doing good work, especially product design on fast-paced teams.

From my long form article on design sprints:

"…especially when it comes to team exercises, you should be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and make sure to space it out as much as possible, otherwise you're wasting not just your time but everyone else's as well."

Do instead of sell. Enough proselytizing, make something instead. For designers, that means to show your ideas via mocks and clickable prototypes. For developers, express yourself via working code for a prototype that looks rough but works for a few key flows.

Just do whatever it takes to build something in an afternoon. Don't disappear for a week building out an all-encompassing final product, and do the opposite by building nothing and just arguing at a whiteboarding. Find that sweet middle spot: build something quickly, have a discussion about it, reject or evolve it, and always keep moving.

Why the emphasis on speed? Nobody has time. It's like the old Hollywood joke about a producer yelling "we've been shooting for a week and we're already a month behind!"

So in my world, execution trumps strategy. Everyone has ideas but real artists ship, even if it's just a prototype to test out an idea.

You can't crowdsource expertise, or, collect feedback from anybody but you can't please everybody.

Designers want respect and a seat at the table? Respect comes from doing great work.
