My approach is bespoke and I don't have a "one size fits all" process for all projects. That said, I do have a few common themes throughout my work and I've distilled a handful of them here.

That's my take on doing good work, especially product design on fast-paced teams.

From my long form article on design sprints:

"...especially when it comes to team exercises, you should be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and make sure to space it out as much as possible, otherwise you’re wasting not just your time but everyone else’s as well."

Do instead of sell. Enough proselytizing, make something instead.

Nobody has time. It's like the old Hollywood joke about a producer yelling "we've been shooting for a week and we're already a month behind!"

Execution trumps strategy. Everyone has ideas but real artists ship, even if it's just a prototype to test out an idea.

You can't crowdsource expertise, or, collect feedback from anybody but you can't please everybody.

Designers want respect and a seat at the table? Respect comes from doing great work.





With all of my harping on speed, independence and most of all, high quality end results, I guess you could say that these are my version of Dieter Rams’ principles of good design, especially at startups.

A good designer knows how to:

Trawl through support requests to understand customer needs.
Interview stakeholders to distill business goals.
Do competitive analysis.
Make their own prototypes to test solutions.
Prioritize feature work.
And countless other things, without having to stop for guidance at every step.
Basically, try to work fast and independently.

And when it comes to group collaboration techniques, keep your powder dry and only gather the entire team when absolutely necessary and for the minimum time possible, to respect their colleagues’ time and energy.






It’s a critical skill for designers to think for themselves amidst the pressure of being vastly outnumbered by other roles. The stakes are high. It’s about more than just doing good individual work, it’s setting the bar for expected product quality for everyone and avoiding the lowest common denominator outcomes.

Don’t just take my word for it, look at the science — there are research studies backing this up. Groupthink is the most common team dynamic and the results of groupthink are inferior to solitary thought by individuals.

So collaboration is great and all but that’s not the only thing you’re hired to do, to make sure everyone gets along no matter how bad the end result. You’re there to make great products and that means you need to be strong, speak up with candor, and most of all, lead.



Be fast & flexible

Here’s my overall principles of how to survive at startups and other demanding environments, all while doing good work and showing design leadership:

* Use an “unprocess”. Pick the right tools at the right time and in a self-sufficient manner, rather than a regimented formal schedule. Think toolbox, not pipeline.
* Keep up team momentum. Work 1-on–1 with various roles and bring the entire team together only in short bursts.
* Understand everyone else’s needs rather than pushing design methods on other people to understand your goals. I.e. practice good user research skills within your own company.
* Avoid groupthink. Don’t shirk hard decisions for the sake of consensus, or you’ll only agree on the lowest common denominator and make Frankenstein designs.
* Think of this as my playbook for the kind of things designers ask about all the time: how to survive as a sole designer amongst engineers and earn the right to be at the decision-making table with business stakeholders.



LIMIT TEAM MEETINGS IN LENGTH & FREQUENCY

For team exercises in particular, I’ve found that the best format to bring everyone together is a long afternoon meeting, regardless of the particular topic or design exercise. It’s just long enough to get their best thinking, yet short enough to fit into an otherwise busy week.

Anything longer than the length of a movie is a corporate group therapy session disguised as real work.




Structured Sketching

Here's a design exercise I actually like, I like it a lot in fact. Originally called a "design studio", the format was a workshop that takes 1 to 2 days, which I modified and cut down to 90 minutes or less to get the same benefits. I wrote an article on the Zapier blog to explain the abbreviated format and documented the one we did at an off-site, but the gist of it is very simple:
