# The Last 6 Months in San Diego

After riding the rollercoaster that is the San Francisco startup scene for 15 years, I moved back to my hometown in early 2020 to be closer to family and old friends. Obviously it ended up not being a great year for exploring the city again and I was head's down with work anyway, so it's only recently that I took up one of my favorite old hobbies: photowalks. 

> “Photography is a love affair with life.” — Burk Uzzle

I just love going by myself or with my dogs to find interesting shots, taking little day trips around town to different spots. I'll put the earbuds in and get into a flow state almost instantly, walking around while pleasantly lost in thought, people-watching and hunting for angles.

Another reason to practice my shooting skills is that I bought an actual real camera last summer, a Sony ZV-1. It came out last year as the first of a series of models made specifically for content creators and vloggers.

Sony ZV-1 with mini tripod, dead cat mic cover, and some sticky baseball bat tape for a nice solid grip.

Well ok, it's technically a point-and-shoot instead of a "real" camera with giant interchangeable lenses, but it's my first non-phone camera in years and more than real enough for me. It's been fun to put it through its paces and re-learn the basics like exposure and aperture.

One really obvious thing that's worth mentioning is that pretty much any camera is good at portrait and macro shots, at least compared to what we've all become conditioned to expect from a smartphone. Even a programmatically-generated "portrait mode" is just no comparison when you want to get a nice crisp foreground subject that's bathed in a deliciously blurred backdrop.

Check out the little details around my dog's face for example, with the intricate whiskers and hairs that usually get wiped out with phone shots:

![../images/photos/2021/SanDiego/processed/IMG_0072.jpg](../images/photos/2021/SanDiego/processed/IMG_0072.jpg)

Also notice the lack of weird color halos or clear spots where the phone might forget to blur.

Or you can also get creative and blur foreground elements as well:

Self-portrait with my handy little camera. Notice that my fingers, the camera and fuzzy mic cover are all blurred out, which is an impossible shot with phones.

It's turned into a fun game to learn my camera better and find the kinds of shots that it's uniquely good at. I could be biased but I think those photos "pop" more, although honestly I'm probably the only one that notices. It's become a pleasantly entertaining hobby even if these details end up going unnoticed by others. 

And that's been the real lesson learned for 2021 so far — rediscovering how much I love doing the occasional photowalk, just as my own personal outlet.

A few more examples of buttery smooth backgrounds that I had fun creating:

I got my nephew into building model kits, right around the same age that I started.

Also, it's been pretty interesting to find the limitations of a camera. Our incredibly capable smartphones have spoiled us and we've come to expect crisp images under most conditions. It was a surprise to find out that there's a wide variety of situations where a bigger camera can't beat our tiny little pocket companions, things like handheld landscape photos or stabilized video. Those types of shots often came out blurry or shaky, and I'd often still prefer my phone shots even if they didn't.

In other words, I found my camera to be really good at a few types of shots and my phone to be pretty good all around in a larger range of situations.

So in the end, my trusty old iPhone X also took a bunch of my favorite photos this year. Plus all of the camera's output would end up on the phone anyway because that's where I do color correction and share to social media, so I definitely got a lot of use out of both devices as a pair.

Another thing that's great about photography as a hobby is that it can be a great icebreaker with strangers that are doing interesting things, like when I came across a mural artist teaching their craft to the next generation in Chicano Park.

With my camera in hand and inspiring me to drive around town for no good reason, I found myself seeking out colorful areas that looked like they had a story to tell.

I'm especially grateful that this year included much-needed getaways to Julian and Big Bear, driving winding backroads through panoramic country scenery.

We took in some majestic views when driving back from Big Bear.

One of the unexpected early highlights of the year was walking around a partially opened Disney California Adventures. It was an incredible opportunity to go into a theme park for free and simply absorb the ambiance without any rides, something that will most likely never happen again.

One thing I missed after moving away was Balboa Park. It's just such a unique location - a world-class zoo, 16 museums and an assortment of theaters, gardens and other cultural highlights, all in one immensely walkable location.

My wife and I love it so much that we got married there!

We're fortunate enough to live near a charming little hippie beach town named Ocean Beach.

Although I grew up here and feel like I know the town inside out, I have to admit that I've been completely oblivious to the San Diego River that runs right through the middle of it. I've seen a few people fish and bike along the banks, but for the most part it's empty by design because it's meant to be unspoilt as possible. For example, kayaking is forbidden except for one time a year during an organized event to clean up litter.

And of course, no photo set of San Diego would be complete without the requisite postcard-worth shots of beaches.
