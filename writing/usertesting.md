user testing for startups/newbies/small teams

cut and past from referly article

update tools (e.g. usertesting.com is off the table)

I mean, is user testing outdated? Is it so easy to throw things up on the screen and then start a conversation with early users? Is usability “solved”? (hahaha, you troll you)
