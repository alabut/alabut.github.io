Tesla’s Killer App For Autonomy Is Hiding In Plain Sight

The outside of the vehicles get all the attention when people talk about design and the jury’s still out on “correct” strategy for the long term, despite all the debate. Is it better to look familiar, like other cars on the road? Or stand out and make a bold futuristic statement, like a DeLorean? Time and sales will tell. 

But the aspect that’s virtually ignored is how the interior design is set up to enable disruption on a completely unappreciated level. Forget the sci-fi concept cars with no steering wheels or weird backwards-facing seats. Seriously, who cares about interior room if you’re throwing up the whole ride? Especially if they drive anything like the test models. Anyone in SF who’s been stuck in traffic behind Cruise and their herky jerky cars stalling out in the middle of an intersection knows what I’m talking about. 

Self-driving cars will happen. Anyone doubting that eventual future is underestimating in the long term. Thankfully the industry seems to also be getting past the initial hype and overestimating in the short term. 

So if you accept the premise that autonomy 1) is an eventuality and 2) it’ll require a more gradual transition, then that’s when you realize that the near future will look like human drivers with autonomous assistance before getting to human drivers supervising autonomous systems on select routes (e.g. on the freeway or in a boring company tunnel) well before it gets to full driverless systems. 

And when you think about that scenario in human factors terms, visualizing what it would actually be like to take a ride in a car driven by a human/machine combo, you know what would be imperative? Communication. Big giant heaps of visual communication about the system, it’s status, what it sees, where it’s going, who it’s interacting with, you name it. 

Like the screens on the back of airplane seats that show trip status - altitude, speed, current location, ETA, etc. Maybe many people won’t care in the long run but those that need the reassurance the most will and most everyone else (if not all) will at first until they get used to robotaxis as a way of life.

And the company with the best interior design for communicating with passengers? Tesla. 

The “one giant place to look” strategy is a level of clarity unseen by any other manufacturer, except Ford’s new electric SUV. Some keep the traditional small screen setup, some more experimental ones go to the other extremes - Canoo got rid of all screens entirely, Porsche’s Taycan and Honda’s E plaster the entire front dashboard - but none of those strategies will communicate with the clarity of purpose as a single, floating big screen. 

And that initial early push to capture the imagination is important. One single company can own the mindshare for a market well into maturity. Tesla could become synonyms with robotaxis the same way previous generations said “put a bandaids on it” or “xerox these documents” without realizing they were using corporate brand names as shorthand for commodities like bandages or copies. The same way uber normalized rides in a stranger’s car and airbnb did the same for sleeping in someone else’s bed, Tesla could be the one to crack robotaxis by 1) using humans as transitional robot substitutes and 2) having an instant global army of cars with interiors optimized for visual digital communication. 

The rest of the industry knows it. That’s the real reason you see these concept videos and demo rides for journalists - they’re just trying to stay in the conversation while Tesla is actively building out and releasing their sleeping army of potential robotaxis, a silent world-wide invasion of hundreds of thousands that’s just waiting for the switch to flip and eat the robotaxi market by creating it overnight. 

Some things seem like a marketplace on paper that are actually winner take all. Search, social networks, online video, family entertainment - consumers have the illusion of choice when in reality they’ll use google, facebook, youtube and Disney in overwhelming numbers.
