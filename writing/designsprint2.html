                            <p>I first ran one of these sessions at a conference I organized called Toolbox and then later while my company was in the Y Combinator Summer 2012 session. It's a great way to validate potential designs in a fast-paced environment and I thought the timing was right for Zapier to do a session as well.</p>

                            <p>But before I get into the format of a new and improved version of design sprints, let's examine what's wrong with the kind that's been evangelized in the last few years.</p>

                            <h2>— Problem #1: Startups Have No Time — </h2>
  

                            <p>One of the reasons I've found this technique to be so useful is because the types of high-pressure environments I’ve worked in can't take off a week (or even just a few days!) from their usual work to do a longer design sprint, the kind practiced by Google Ventures and explained in <a href="#">their book.</a></p>

                            <p>Yet at the same time, those are exactly the kind of teams that are most in need of a solid product direction. The typically frenetic and chaotic pace of feature development of early companies or products runs into avoidable pot holes and cul de sacs more often than not. So how do you reconcile the massive need with the complete lack of time?</p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">It's impossible for most startups to press pause on the entire company for a week, no matter how dire the state of design is. A long afternoon meeting is all they can realistically handle in the real world.</p>

                            <p>The answer isn't to cram a week's worth of design activities into less time, it's to be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and design insights. <!-- That's exactly what the mini sprint format does with nothing more than markers, paper, and a stopwatch. --></p>


                            <p>That's why this mini sprint technique is a more efficient way to get the core benefit of a much longer design sprint. All you really want to do is <strong>ilicit the best ideas from every team member and synthesize them into concrete product directions.</strong></p>

                            <p>It's especially useful for designers outnumbered by a much larger team of engineers, sales, customer support, and various other stakeholders, all with their unique backgrounds and hunches for product improvements. You're not going to get them all to down tools for a work week and play artsy games with post-its and crayons, nor can you process everyone's input at all times without losing your mind. What you need is a way to harness the firehose in a short manageable burst: get all the ideas that have been pent up throughout the team and crowdsource various design approaches in a parallel manner.</p>

                            <p>In short, you promote yourself to being a design manager for a day and deputize everyone else into being temporary designers, creating work in bulk that you then vet and synthesize into possible design projects for later.</p>

                            <p>Being the only designer at an early stage company is exceedingly difficult. You can go mad trying to strike a balance between being in an overly reactive mode and trying to create visuals for all of the various ideas without much thought, like a design monkey randomly throwing mud on the wall to see what sticks, versus being overly proactive and prescriptive with only a solipsistic approach to which ideas get design help, becoming a bottleneck for the entire company.</p>

                            <p>What you want to do is to strike a balance between accepting divergent trains of thought and synthesizing down to only the best or most achievable ideas. I.e. to get everyone's best ideas but also have a modicum of vetting so that... [Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.]</p>
    
                            <h2>— Problem #2: Whiteboarding Has Inherent Flaws — </h2>

                            <p>Ok, now I'm about to attack one of the sacred cows of the business world: whiteboards. It's not just a tool for designers, it's how everyone does their best thinking and collaboration, right?</p>

                            <p>Don't get me wrong, I love the things. I feel like I can hardly think without one in the room and an office without one looks strangely naked, like it's missing desks and chairs or something. [insert anecdote about AOL's whiteboard walls and how it got me to work in such a corporate environment?]</p>

                            <p>But just because it's good for 2-3 people to use at a time doesn't make it a good tool for larger groups of people. In fact, it has some very subtle drawbacks:</p>

                            <h2>— Format —</h2>

                            <p>So that's enough about the problems of a week-long design sprint. How do you run a mini sprint instead? All it takes is paper, markers, a stopwatch and about 90 minutes of free time.</p>

                            <h3>Setup &amp; Prep</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Split into teams and select topics</em></li></ul>

                            <p>On a Sunday afternoon during our week-long retreat, I introduced myself as moderator and got the session started.</p>

                            <p>I fired up a short slideshow to explain the format of the design session and list a handful of topics that had been floating around our Slack channels as potential projects. We voted for the top three and split into teams, with one project as the focus for each group.</p>

                            <h3>Three Rounds Of Sketching &amp; Presentations</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>10 minutes per round (5 min sketching + 5 min discussion)</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Now our small company was ready for a highly structured session of sketching and brainstorming.</p>

                            <p>We did three rounds of activity. Each round was 10 minutes long, with 5 minutes of sketching designs on the pads and 5 minutes of discussion.</p>

                            <p>Here’s the really important bit: <strong>every round has a different format and with silent reflective time built in,</strong> in order to stimulate individual thought and avoid groupthink.</p>

                            <h3>1st Round: Silent Sketching Of 6 Ideas</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>The focus of this round is divergence — come up with many different approaches.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Every person sketched silently by themselves without talking to anyone and jotted down their initial ideas.</p>

                            <p>To help them come up with several concepts and not get locked into a single approach, <strong>I had everyone do what’s called a 6-up by dividing their first paper into six evenly-sized boxes,</strong> which they had to try to fill up with as many different concepts as possible.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8069/8244486731_6ca1d0a95a_b.jpg"></p>

                            <p>Sketching 6-ups is one of those ingeniously simple techniques that I use all the time to come up with new ideas and love sharing with others. What makes it so stimulating is that you get the obvious ideas out of your system first, which then forces you to stretch the mental muscles a bit to fill the remaining boxes.</p>

                            <p>Then at the end of the 5 minutes, each subteam got 5 minutes total for each member to take a minute to describe the various ideas they had.</p>

                            <p>The point of this round is to start by casting a wide net for different approaches. Three team members all drawing six thumbnail sketches each pretty much insured that there would be at least a few surprise curveball ideas among the 18 or so drawings.</p>

                            <h3>2nd Round: Incorporate Feedback</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Switch from divergence to convergence - stop brainstorming and start picking the best ideas to iterate on.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Everyone went back to 5 minutes of sketching alone without talking again, but this time with new instructions: they were required to steal at least one idea from one of their team members that they had just heard about.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546016366-bf061374d54e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1300&amp;q=80"></p>

                            <p>Then the subteams got another 5 minutes for everyone to share their work. The focus of this round was to begin to switch from divergence to convergence - to start picking the best ideas from the crop and evolving them.</p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">In practice, the ideas are firing rapidly and it’s hard to get people to shut up at the end of the 5 minutes to move on to the next round. That’s a good sign! It means the ideas are flowing.</p>

                            <h3>3rd round: Group Brainstorming &amp; Design Decisions</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Make collaborative design decisions.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>For the final round of sketching, the sub-teams now had a new task. Instead of sketching individually without talking, they had to do the exact opposite: now they had to sketch a single set of interfaces as a group and talk their way into consensus.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532622785990-d2c36a76f5a6?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1350&amp;q=80"></p>

                            <h3>Final Presentations</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Time to show your work.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Then comes the fun part - seeing what everyone came up with. The sub-teams all presented to the rest of the company and got insights into the different projects.</p>

                            <p>We found that people naturally and organically gravitated towards the sub-teams where they had been thinking about the most. For example our support team had a lot of thoughts to share about our onboarding process, the developers clustered together to talk about the platform for third-party integrations, and our marketing folks tackled app discovery and exploration.</p>

                            <p>So it ended up that there was at least one person on each sub-team that will be involved in implementing ideas on the related project.</p>

                            <p>So at this point you might be asking yourself - isn't this just as good as using a whiteboard? Are paper sketches and timed rounds really necessary for these types of insights?</p><p>[INSERT LINK TO WHITEBOARD POST?]</p>

                            <p>Those are fair questions, so to go a bit deeper on why this technique works so well compared to the usual Sharpie battles on a whiteboard, a mini sprint can:</p>

                            <ul class="double-entry-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Simultaneously create divergent ideas and convergent decisions.</strong>
                                    Typically, idea generation is diametrically opposed to synthesis. This new technique would have to both come up with a variety of ideas as well as organize them without spinning off into useless orbits, which are often opposing goals.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Balance individual contribution with group insights.</strong>
                                    The technique is an automatic failure if it’s no better than just thinking about a problem by yourself or going with the lowest common denominator from groupthink.

                                    <strong>Quickly express visual ideas.</strong>
                                    It must be visual instead of mainly text so that it’s not in danger of turning into  <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/archives/001050.php">a boring functional spec with an illusion of agreement.</a> Rough little drawings can done rapidly and ideas can be expressed fast enough to evolve them in a loose conversational manner.

                                    <strong>Be extremely multi-threaded. </strong>
                                    It would be ideal to crank through ideas for several projects simultaneously, rather than walking through each concept linearly.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Be easily archived. </strong>
                                    Using paper instead of whiteboards makes it ideal for flipping back through past ideas, instead of being stuck on a single drawing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Be actually fun! </strong>
                                    There’s a reason why everyone feels comfortable grabbing sharpies and drawing rough sketches, so anything to replace it has to be equally approachable and engaging. It also has to be something everyone can do and doesn’t require the skills of a designer to visualize the hard parts.

                            <p>So that’s how you run one of these suckers. Whether it’s called a mini sprint, design studio, visual brainstorming or just plain sketching, I haven’t seen this exact format discussed much online. That’s a shame, since it’s super unique and a bit of a hidden gem in my designer’s toolkit.</p>
                            <p>This is one of my favorite methods for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions bursting with ideas for design work and I'm sure you will too.</p>
