## Launching an email newsletter

"Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later."

- Tim Berners Lee

The web was born as basically a contact directory in academia. Completely coincidentally, my career started in the exact same way.

Let's back up to the early 90's. On one side of the planet, a British guy was toiling away in the administrative bowels of an international research lab, trying to keep up with the byzantine complexity of his workplace. Created a decade after WW2, CERN had a noble mission - to use science as a bonding mechanism and force for good between previously warring European countries - but you have to trust me when I say that trying to get anything done at a prestigious research institution often feels like you're living out scenes from Terry Gilliam's Brazil.

International collaboration at CERN's scale was uniquely challenging in those years, to say the least. Thousands of scientists from different countries were constantly coming and going, all squirreled away in separate clusters of labs with different contact information. Just tracking someone down in the pre-cell phone era was a logistical nightmare, not to mention actually trying to learn about their research.

“In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer.”

- Tim Berners Lee

Hence this frazzled yet ingenious Brit created something puzzling to his colleagues but extraordinary in hindsight: the first web page, something you can still see to this day on CERN's website.







Something something CERN story... maybe link/photo to Weaving The Web. Then came Netscape Mosiac during my first year in college and you'd guess in hindsight that it was an immediate hit that skyrocketed in popularity.

Nope, it was mostly confined to the computer labs on college campuses.  (fact check, when did AOL popularize shit?) Speaking of computer labs on college campuses...

Something about how I blew off the web as a fad? CD-ROM's were amazing. Video clips of Captain Picard speaking about an entry!

This would not be the first time I'd get it horribly wrong about misjudging a massive success in its early days. In fact that would become a mainstay of my career, blowing off opportunities like joining Airbnb when they were all still crammed into the founder's Victorian apartment and not publicizing their secret round from Sequoia. Whoops.





Ten timezones away, a teenager was finding out that his lifelong dream of becoming a scientist was a nightmare, more grant-chasing than actual science. Something something dark years in the wilderness, then ICASSP and UCSD contact directories. Realize now looking back that I just hadn't found my thing yet and was itching for the chaos that is a new frontier, not something that made me feel like yet another worker on the factory floor. 

No that's not it either because I also didn't want theater.

Save all this meta talk for later! Get back to the story...

Funny that I didn't realize that tech was going to be my career, considering how I'd been into computers my whole life until then. Link to TI 99/4A...

While that was going on at work, blogging was blowing my mind away from it. Talk about how important it was early in my career, meeting friends, reading about SF exploits like Adaptive Path, inventing the word blog, Hackers and Painters, Joel Spolsky. I even proposed to my wife while wearing a Daring Fireball t-shirt.

Something funny happened on the way to San Francisco - I stopped blogging. I made friends that kept the flame alive - Jason Shen, Paul Stammy - and winced while it became a commercialized industry and then mourned its passing as it flamed out in favor of simpler but idiosyncratic platforms like Medium. 

All was not lost though and I've been inspired lately by the small and craftsman-like resurgence of the indie web. Craig Mod's writing about writing, Arun V about design.









So I'm back. The writing muscles are a little sore and still getting built back up, but the words are flowing. I joined my friend Pinguino and her buddy Hannibal in a weekly blogging challenge a few months ago and our little three-man-circus has given me the momentum and confidence to launch this newsletter. I've got 8 articles up already and a few more on deck, so that gives me a decent buffer to account for an inevitable off week.

The writing so far has been mainly work-related - tech, startups, programming, etc - but also the occasional personal post about things like photography, so we'll see where this journey goes as I find my writing voice. So join me to blah blah blah...
