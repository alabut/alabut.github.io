                            <p>User testing has its roots in the Human-Computer Interaction departments of universities, which in turn descended from the ergonomic and functional testing of cockpits for jet pilots.</p>

                            <p>Fun fact for space nerds like me: <strong>it&#8217;s not a coincidence that all of the early NASA astronauts were test pilots.</strong></p>

                            <p>Contrary to what you may have seen in movies, NASA didn't choose to use test pilots because of their bravado. It&#8217;s because they were already trained in using and evaluating unfinished equipment under high pressure situations, as well as doing the kind of Method Acting needed to imagine different scenarios and give feedback about how to improve the controls for each situation.</p>

                            <p>In other words, test pilots can imagine how a machine <em>should</em> work in the future, for them and for others, not just how it <em>does</em> work today.</p>

                            <p>This is opposed to the mindset of most pilots, which are handed the finished product and have to learn all the ins and outs of the unalterable machine that they&#8217;re stuck with.</p>

                            something something about how they went on to have an active role in the development of spacecraft, then which led to ergonomics in academia, and then sprung an offshoot for computers.

                            <h2>Rise of the Web</h2>

                            <p>Back to web nerdery. The early 2000&#8217;s witnessed the rise of user-centered design and the birth of UX as an industry, with advocates including Steve Krug and Jared Spool leading the way with influential books and articles. The expert that had the biggest effect on me personally was Jakob Nielsen, who popularized guerilla usability testing through his influential website useit.com and a series of books like the landmark Designing Web Usability.</p>

                            <p>I remember flipping through his book at the university bookstore and it was right around the time I got my first &#8220;real&#8221; web job, at the Biology department. It was at the top of my wishlist of things to buy it with my first paycheck, only to have my boss hand me a copy for free instead.</p>

                            <p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate Nielsen&#8217;s influence at the time. Before he popularized and legitimized guerilla methods, user testing was a technique that was done only by white-coated academic types presiding over expensive labatories with over-the-shoulder TV cameras, eye tracking equipment, and two-way mirrors hiding a room full of important stakeholders. Nielsen blew all of that up and brought usability testing to the masses, by showing that quick informal testing wasn&#8217;t simply a cheaper alternative, but that it was measurably better because it could be done more readily and often. It&#8217;s probably no coincidence that software development was going through it&#8217;s own revolution at the same time and that similarly iterative methodologies like Agile and XP were spreading through the programming world. The combination of quick user testing to reveal problem areas and rapid software development to create solutions forms the blueprint for today&#8217;s product development, particularly at early stage startups and fast-paced internal teams.</p>

                            <h2>Modern Techniques</h2>

                            <p>Things have changed since those early days of guerilla user testing though and now there&#8217;s a couple different ways to inexpensively and quickly highlight usability issues:</p>

                            <h1><strong>in person, moderated and lightly scripted.</strong> Whether done in an expensive lab or a quick informal office setting, this is the traditional format of a usability test and this is the easiest one to learn and get started with. A quick definition of terms: <strong>in person</strong> means that you&#8217;re sitting down with the user, <strong>moderated</strong> means that there&#8217;s someone talking to the user and acting as a sort of referee to keep things on track, and <strong>scripted</strong> means that there&#8217;s a fixed set of tasks that the moderator wrote down in advance and wants the user to accomplish.</h1>

                            <h1><strong>in person, moderated and unscripted.</strong> This is the Listening Lab technique popularized by Mark Hurst, which can take a bit more experience and finesse to pull off while still gathering valid usability insights and without turning into a completely unstructured focus group. It&#8217;s unscripted because the moderator involves the user in coming up with the tasks they want to accomplish before diving into trying the app, based on their demographic background that&#8217;s screened in advance, a loose conversation about their interests, or their impressions of external marketing pages.</h1>

                            <h1><strong>remote and moderated (scripted or unscripted).</strong> This is roughly the same as the two techniques above, except the moderator and user aren&#8217;t phsyically present in the same room and use a video app like Skype to connect instead. This is especially a boon to early stage projects, when initial early users can come from any part of the world.</h1>

                            <h1><strong>remote, asynchronous and heavily scripted.</strong> This is enabled by relatively new tools like Usertesting.com, where the moderator and user don&#8217;t chat in real time and the user is left on their own to follow step-by-step instructions on how to use the site or app in question, while their mouse movement and audio feedback is recorded.</h1>

                            <h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>

                            <p>They each have their own set of tradeoffs. The first three techniques all yield a gold mine of insights, while the last one is crazy quick to set up. I&#8217;ve become a huge fan of Usertesting.com in the last 2 years because they have their own army of test subjects on standby, ready to go at a moment&#8217;s notice. It&#8217;s also much easier to share the raw video and your annotated insights with the rest of your team, and it&#8217;s super quick to recycle a script once you&#8217;ve written it and run another test.</p>

                            <p>It used to be a pain in the ass and giant production when I had to explain how to get started with user testing. <strong>Now I tell people to just try Usertesting.com out first, then graduate to the moderated versions later when they&#8217;re more comfortable.</strong></p>

                            <h2>Realistic Test Environment</h2>

                            <p>There&#8217;s an additional powerful component that overlaps with another tool of UX called ethnography - you&#8217;re placing the users in a more realistic scenario because they&#8217;re using their own computers in the comfort of their own home and asking them only for about 15&#8211;20 minutes of their time.</p>

                            <p>Compare that to the hoops you ask someone to jump through when testing them in person: they go to craigslist, see your ad for test subjects, try to guess from the description whether it&#8217;s worth it to take a long lunch and try something new, then they walk over to do something they barely understand, all just to get a measly $50. It&#8217;s an artificial environment and setup, you&#8217;re lucky if you get enough non-whacko participants, and it takes a lot of skill to decode the feedback you&#8217;ll get. You can do a phone screen to weed out that sullen weirdos that are clearly just trying to earn a buck, but even the friendly conversational types that show up have a problem: they&#8217;re eager to please and ready to overcome any usability hurdles in your app in order to feel like they&#8217;ve earned their monetary reward. They act like they&#8217;re being tested, no matter how much you try to make it conversational and tell them to relax.</p>

                            <h2>In-person Tests Still Rule</h2>

                            <p>The upside of in person testing is worth all of the headaches in setting up and decoding the feedback though, because it&#8217;ll highlight your most challenging usability obstacles like nothing else. It&#8217;s uniquely motivating to see a handful of energetic people throw themselves in fifteen different ways against an interface and not be able to figure out how to use a particular function. It ends all circular debates on a team about priorities when you&#8217;re crowded around a video or live stream of real live humans wandering through the maze, unable to find the cheese that the rest of you can see so plainly.</p>

                            <p>We did a lot of usability testing while I was at isocket and the CEO John Ramey was absolutely relentless in drumming up victims for me to play with. There was a particularly memorable remote session I ran of a new customer in Canada. I had the entire engineering team crowded around two monitors as I moderated the session and the first few steps of setting up his account went pretty smoothly. Then he hit a snag when he decided to create his first ad format. It dragged on for a few minutes and kept trying to get him back on track as he poked around every conceivable page, read aloud the relevant help section, and did everything except hit his head on the desk. All the while, I could see that our engineer Alicia was red-faced, building up steam and ready to explode! So I kept my trigger finger on the mute and would occasionally give her the nod that it was ok to vent, and she yell &#8220;HIT THE BIG GREEN BUTTON&#8221; at the top of her lungs.</p>

                            <p>It turns out that even though we realized that creating an ad was our most important function and we put a huge button in a contrasting color in a visually dominant position at the top left of every single page, it was getting lost in the UI and practically invisible because it was integrated into the navigation and users would search the body of the page instead. Most of our users apparently had a pretty strict mental model that the navigation is for getting around and the page is for doing stuff. Lesson learned.</p>

                            <h2>Drunken Usability Testing</h2>

                            <p>Mobile apps are an interesting caveat to the drawbacks of in-person user testing though, since it&#8217;s so easy to walk up to a group of people at a bar and ask them to try your app in exchange for a few drinks. It&#8217;s a technique that my friend Hang calls Drunken Usability Testing - if someone can use your app in a dark crowded environment when they&#8217;re distracted and possibly hammered out of their gourd, then you can be pretty confident that it&#8217;ll work in calmer situations. You can even do a rough screen of demographics: male/female, young/old, preppy/cool, etc.</p>

                            <h2>Still Underutilized</h2>

                            <p>These different types of user testing are so simple to learn and try out. So why are they so often overlooked or confused with other forms of feedback? I&#8217;ve run into a lot of places that say they&#8217;re doing usability tests simply because they&#8217;re responding to emails or talking to people on the phone.</p>

                            <p>One reason might be because usability tests are both really easy to do and easy to screw up. And my guess is that when you screw up, the reason you tend to skew towards turning it into a friendly conversation (which is all focus groups really are) is because you feel lucky to have someone give you their time to try something out for you and you don&#8217;t want it to feel like an interrogation by hounding them with lots of pointed questions.</p>

                            <p>Or maybe it&#8217;s because people just don&#8217;t realize that there&#8217;s a difference between the two types of feedback and break the rules that divide them, or don&#8217;t care that there&#8217;s a difference at all because hey, any interaction with users is good and we&#8217;ll learn something, right? Let&#8217;s just collect whatever feedback we can and surmise what people really mean later.</p>

                            <p>That&#8217;s like saying that filmmakers should shoot as much film as they can and they&#8217;ll sort it all out in the editing booth later. You still need to go into a shoot with some kind of plan, with storyboards and a script. It&#8217;s the same with product development, or you&#8217;re just a monkey throwing crap on the wall to see what sticks.</p>

                            <h2>Common Mistakes with Moderating Tests</h2>

                            <p>The problem with usability testing is that it&#8217;s easy to be lead astray and start drawing the wrong conclusions by running afoul of a few hidden pitfalls, things like:</p>

                            <ul>
                            <li>asking leading or hypothetical questions.</li>
                            <li>letting the conversation swerve towards subjective aesthetics rather than objective functionality.</li>
                            <li>indulging participants when they talk about other hypothetical situations or types of users.</li>
                            <li>filling in blank silences with chatter.</li>
                            <li>letting silences go on too long until test subjects start to blush and feel stupid.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The most dangerous misstep is intentional confirmation bias - seeking out or only tuning into answers that affirm what you already think is great or problematic about your darling creation. If your heart is already set on blowing away some login form or implementing a shiny new feature, you&#8217;ve got too much wax in your ears to really listen well. It takes just as much practice to listen intently to people&#8217;s viewpoints as it does to talk and convince them of something you believe.</p>

                            <p>Don&#8217;t let this be a reason to stop you from trying your hand at running a usability test. It&#8217;s still more art than science - especially when it comes to decoding feedback - which means that it takes practice and you&#8217;ll only get better if you keep trying.</p>

                            <h2>Beware of Focus Groups</h2>

                            <p>So what&#8217;s wrong with focus groups? Nothing, if you know when and why to use them. You&#8217;d almost always want to use them before you have a product, as unstructured conversations where you take the initial spark of an initial entrepreneurial hunch and test whether it has the potential to flame into something bigger. They&#8217;re great for finding out whether people have similar pain points as you do in a particular class of product and for giving you ideas about patterns of behavior in the market - high level overviews and research into demographics.</p>

                            <p>Usability testing, on the other hand, is a ground level exercise for learning specific things about an existing product (I&#8217;m a huge fan of paper prototyping for internal product development but not for using them in tests - it feels like weird art school bullshit to tell people to pretend some scribbles are a real interface and the feedback tends to be floaty and uneven).</p>

                            <p>This rule can be broken and the two types can be combined into what Mark Hurst calls a Listening Lab, but that&#8217;s a bit of advanced kung fu in my opinion and you should learn the basics first.</p>

                            <h2>Just Dive In!</h2>

                            <p>So that about wraps it up! The best way to learn is by doing something and thankfully, usability testing is pretty easy to get into. It doesn&#8217;t take any specialized skills or equipment, you don&#8217;t need anyone&#8217;s permission, and the results are always a welcome conversation starter.</p>

                            <p>I apologize for the Kalzemeus-like length of this blog post but hey, it was 10 years in the making. Let me know how it goes for you or if you have any questions about getting started by dropping me a note at al@refer.ly.</p>

                            <h2>Bonus Material: B2b Apps &amp; Customer Development</h2>

                            <p>Here&#8217;s an extra chapter that won&#8217;t apply to all of you, but if you&#8217;ve read this far and are eager to learn more, then you&#8217;re welcome to keep on trucking! Especially if you want to learn how usability tests can help with customer development early in the product development cycle.</p>

                            <p>Although I love making something that a lot of mainstream consumers will use, there&#8217;s some twists to testing B2B stuff instead and I couldn&#8217;t help but write up what I love about business apps. It&#8217;s both easier and harder in some unique ways.</p>

                            <p>It&#8217;s easier to find people willing to give you feedback when you tell them about a product related to their job or industry. Hell, they&#8217;ll even pay you to be test subjects (&#8220;get into our private beta early!&#8221; or &#8220;first 3 months free!&#8221;) and give all kinds of enthusiastic advice, rather than having to be paid to try your product and prodded to give feedback about something they only marginally care about.</p>

                            <p>One downside is that there&#8217;s often a smaller finite pool of possible users and you often only get one shot to win their business, so you can&#8217;t just throw a half-baked piece of crap in front of them and have that be the first impression. You&#8217;re basically wrapped up in the customer development process and have to treat the tail end of the session as sales, where you switch from gaining insights about their mindset to helping them discover the features they need and make sure that the mini tutorial you give them will set them up to be happy early users, ones that hopefully will give you not only their business but feedback over time on how to make the product even better.</p>

                            <h2>Held to a Higher Standard</h2>

                            <p>Being part of customer development also means that you have to ask tougher questions than a typical consumer product. Rather than simply observing whether they can use the product, you need to find out whether this is something they want so badly that they&#8217;d pay for it. It can be an expensive waste of time to find out you&#8217;ve made something that has a slick UX and people would flow right through it like lightening if they wanted to, only to find out that they don&#8217;t.</p>

                            <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean pivoting every 3 weeks like a caffeinated chipmunk, it just means being sensitive to whether people are running into straightforward usability obstacles, if they understand the problem the app is solving, or if there&#8217;s a larger issue about whether it&#8217;s useful at all.</p>

                            <p>One extreme example of testing demand and utility (rather than just usability) is something Dan Martell described in an interview. While building Flowtown, he sketched and iterated until he had the basic app flow down, then hired a visual designer to build out a static, high fidelity and product ready mockup of the app, which Dan then shopped around to potential customers to get feedback. The turning point in any of these meetings was when he&#8217;d ask them for a $50 prepayment. That&#8217;s when it would turn from a friendly conversation to a more pointed one, with more detailed questions from the test customer that revealed their mindset when making a purchasing decision.</p>
