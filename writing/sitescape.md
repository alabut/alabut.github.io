# Starting A New Job!
## I'm the new Head of Product at SiteScape, an AR startup

Something something construction, B1M and Real Engineering on youtube, admired Plangrid from afar.

AR is in an interesting place - the world's most valuable company just reduced the cost of a LIDAR sensor from thousands of dollars to pretty much nothing, throwing it in for free in their pro models of phone and tablets. And the world promptly did nothing with it... at least in the consumer space. The business world took notice and started excitedly exploring the potential for this idea.

And so SiteScape was born. They've already gone viral on TikTok - twice - and I'll be building out their Pro features for commercial users.

But the mobile app is free and always will be! It's perfect for all kinds of regular people. Now you don't have to be a professional architect or CAD expert to do a 3D laser scan of the bathroom you want to remodel. 

On a personal front, I'm super excited by how much there is to learn, things that were on my personal backlog and that I wanted to tackle on my own time anyway: SwiftUI has reached a maturity level where I'm seeing designers prototype in it, and apps like Blender have democratized 3D for the masses.

Thanks to the CEO Andy for looking me up on XXX and my old boss Sven for explaining the parallels to Cake/vouching for my skills on tight timelines.
