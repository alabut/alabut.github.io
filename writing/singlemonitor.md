# The case for single monitors

I came across some pictures of my home office last year and it reminded me of how I usually like to set up my rig for work:

One of my mindless timewasters is to scroll through the beautiful shots of gaming and computer desk setups on Instagram, but they're almost all dual screens though, so I thought I’d explain why I’m a fan of vertical clamshell stands with a single monitor and have been for years.

It might not be for everyone, so go ahead and try two or more screens but don’t feel weird if it feels weird and you can't put your finger on why. If you don’t like it, then go against the grain and try a single monitor instead of the usual laptop + monitor setup. I’ve sworn by my approach for years and would often get weird looks at work for using vertical clamshell stands but trust me, they're awesome and worth giving a test drive.

Basically, working on a single monitor is a more focused experience. There’s some evidence that it’s a higher cognitive load to constantly visually scan between multiple monitors, especially if they're not of the same dimensions.

For me though personally, it's more anecdotal experience than just trusting the science blindly: I feel like I get into a flow state more often with a single monitor and I always felt a little scattered with multiple screens instead, with my eyes constantly bouncing around and scanning for new info.

Also on a practical level for designers, it's better for the laptop since the graphics card gets better performance from driving only one monitor, plus also being vertical means better heat dissipation.

And lastly, you can see from my setup that the laptop also doubles as a headphone stand ;)
