Revised Outline for Design Sprints Article

# It’s taken the design world by storm
    1. It’s like agile for creatives - it’s part of the vocabulary now whether you use it or not. 
    2. It’s easy to learn, emphasizes collaboration, shortcuts engineering overhead with testable prototypes that force you out of the building, focuses on execution within a specific timeframe, compared to the vague and hand wavy “design thinking”.
    3. It’s probably also great for newbies that are still learning (pragmatic learning quote about levels of skill acquisition) (insert Tanner quote? Ping him for draft review) and large companies with stakeholders that can get involved as clients for a week without derailing developers and others. 
# Some designers are wary
    1. If that all sounds great, then why would anyone object?
    2. I thought maybe it was just the teams I was used to - super scrappy seed stage - but pinging others made me realize it might be more about the experience level of the designer than the situation. 
# Problem 1 is time
# Problem 2 is “design thinking” is horseshit
# Problem 3 is hilarious and it stays
	1. but grab the execution link and move it to problem 2
# Change problem 4 to groupthink in general?
# Some kind of wrap up or transition.
	1. (What I do instead. What should a good process look like then? Should I bring back a truncated version of Benefits?)
	2. Remember to acknowledge prior art. I first heard about this from Will Evans, back when he was a visiting speaker at IXDASF.
# Mini sprint format
# Results
	1. (acknowledge that these are just mine? Ping Will what’s his face for more data?)
# Ending and call to arms/feedback/etc.
    1. If you’re chaffing under the format of design sprints like I did with agile when I was starting out, just know that:
        1. there is another way, more flexible and based on several techniques rather than a single process. 
        2. Chucking all collaboration isn’t the answer. You’ve still got to learn the basics before you ignore or amend them.
    2. And if you’re not chaffing and love design sprints on a team that is down to try them:
        1. then never mind and forget what I said, just have fun with learning your craft. 
        2. Don’t worry about whether the deliverables are world changing or fix all of your business needs in 5 days; think of it more as a team building exercise that indoctrinates the value of design and familiarizes everyone with the tools of the trade. Teamwork is the ultimate end result because the team will still be there while sprints and other techniques come and go.
