                            <p><span class="ornamental-first-letter">D</span>esign Sprints have spread far and wide from their original development at startups and have become a ubiquitous practice on a global scale at a wide range of organizations, commercial or otherwise. It&#8217;s a good bet that any designer reading this probably already knows what they are.</p>

                            <p>It’s like the way all engineers are familiar with the basic principles of agile development, even if they don’t rigidly follow every step of the process. The ideas are just part of our common vocabulary now.</p>

                            <p>But now that it's been a few years, it&#8217;s worth taking a step back to ask: are design sprints right for everyone? And if not, then what are alternative collaboration techniques?</p>

                            <p>Just to state this up front as a disclaimer: I’m not against design sprints, agile development, lean startups, or any other business techniques.</p>

                            <p>I’m a process omnivore and devoured them all when I was figuring out my own approach in the first half of my career. I tried many different things, kept the bits that worked and never stayed wedded to any one single approach. Over time, I formed my own flexible and idiosyncratic methods, ones that play to my own unique strengths and chosen work environments, but I still see the value in methodologies that don't apply to my line of work.</p>

                            <p>Even waterfall has it&#8217;s place. There&#8217;s a reason it helped organize half a million government employees in the 60&#8217;s for the space program!</p>

                            <p>Personality, work environment, seniority - these factors explain why your mileage will vary on any advice, from me or anyone else. Everyone has different learning styles, experience levels, and industries, so you should take that all into account and consider the context of any advice before applying it to you or your field.</p>

                            <p>The supposed benefits of any technique depends on your own preferences, experience and circumstances.</p>

                            <p>So like a business edition of the Rashomon effect, what I’m saying is that “good process” is relative and not everything is a universal truth. This is my own personal take on the role of design in the business world and consider this your warning that I&#8217;m an unreliable narrator in the story that follows...</p>

                            <h3>Ditches UX Dogma</h3>

                            <p>It's fun to shortcut engineering overhead and jump straight into action. Design sprints upend decades of UX dogma and skip past research techniques that add unnecessary overhead for questionable benefits.</p>

                            <p>From Jonathan Courtney&#8217;s article <em><a href="https://medium.com/p/user-research-is-overrated-6b0fe101d41">User Research is Overrated</a></em>:</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Up-front user research is a form of product procrastination. It’s busy-work, it’s a way to avoid making hard decisions. It delays the need to make something tangible.</p>
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>&#8230;and&#8230;</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>It took a while, but eventually [&#8230;] we figured out that even though it was nice to “have the user in mind” when designing, the useful data came from the first user tests, not the research.</p>
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>User interviews, focus groups, personas, empathy maps, mindmapping, ethnographic field studies&#8230; <em>it&#8217;s all a bit much.</em> Especially if you&#8217;re not in a large corporate environment and trying to sell the value of a project before it even starts.</p>

                            <p>In the last few years, &#8220;UX research&#8221; has quickly become synonymous with &#8220;enterprise red tape&#8221; and the explosion of startups will only add to the effect. Although there might always be large companies with rigid hierarchies, the trend is definitely towards smaller and quicker teams that just get down to business.</p>

                            <p>You don&#8217;t have to skip the research, you can use sprints in combination with traditional UX techniques if you get value out of them and have the bandwidth.</p>

                            <p>But for a lot of people, pseudoscientific research isn&#8217;t the work you signed up to do. You&#8217;re not in some anthropology class about technology, you&#8217;re an action-oriented type that just wants to make cool and useful stuff. </p>

                            <p>Compared to the previous 20 years of UX dogma, it&#8217;s just a much more natural approach to brainstorm up ideas, sketch out a few, and then test out some prototypes on prospective users.</p>

                            <h2 id="reception">In Conclusion</h2>

                            <p>Design sprints have clear upsides and it’s easy to see why the practice has such widespread appeal. It’s simple to learn, emphasizes collaboration, and uses testable prototypes to shortcut engineering overhead, all within a specific timeframe.</p>

                            <p>It's become a worldwide phenomenon and you can see the palpable enthusiasm from people trying it for the first time:</p>
