# Fantastic Quote

> *"I am utterly and completely tired of anyone who claims to have a one size fits all design process to solve all problems. It's lazy, misleading, and a sign of junior designer who can't objectively choose the right process for the current problem."*
> Senior Designer Friend Who Shall Not Be Named, Unless They Change Their Mind After Reading This Draft *hint* *hint* :)

There's some others I can pull in from public sources, but started with designing the shit out of this little info card first! Use the art direction from the post-it on Pablo Stanley and Feedbin (that's some proper creativity remixing action, baby)

# Intro

I remember being really surprised when design sprints first came out and started to get popularized by etc etc etc...

I liked it at first! It looked like all of the good deeds that designers try to do in one succint package: group brainstorming, usability tests, quick prototypes, etc.

So why would my opinion on it ever sour? I should be exactly the target audience for someone like this: used to being a lone wolf on small fast teams, a former developer using technical skills to integrate better with engineers, as well as more quickly implement and iterate on my own work. Someone comfortable with the sprint format from the agile development world.

It's an admirable goal to be inspired by agile sprints to integrate designers into a more nimble approach. But to paraphrase [an old saying about regular expressions:](https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems/) some people wrestling with the design problems at a typical startup think "I know, I'll use agile-inspired techniques to make design more like engineering." Now you've got two problems.

Admirable goals and not surprising that such an engineering- and collaboration-centric approach comes from google. This sounds like an ad hominem attack but I always think it's useful to examine where "rules" come from to understand their context and better gauge whether it applies to my work. I'm defintely not anti-process, in fact I'm a process omnivore, if anything: I like to pick and choose which bits to steal from and make my own idiosyncratic methods. 

*find and insert link to 37signals about process?*

*maybe also link to the Wired expose on Google's crazy ass culture, plus a techmeme podcast reference to their duplication of Nest@home software and/or reference Gruber's joke about the google.io drinking game: do a shot whenever they announce a new chatbot, or even any duplicate feature actually LOL*

Possibly also tarnish IDEO and other agencies that sourced this methodology? Or just stick to burning bridges at Google LOL

And let's be real about Agile With A Capital A: it's a properly childish response to environments where stakeholders have requests that are certifiably insane and engineers have habits around transparency, communication and scope that are practically autistic. (ugh, maybe find a less insensitive descriptor)

Come on, you know these archetypes and I don't have to out any workplaces by name to give examples of snobby entitled stakeholders that think engineers go off the rails and do shoddy work if they aren't spoonfed exactly what to work on and given visuals to make up for their utter lack of even basic design skills, and overloaded engineers that are forced into impossible horsetrading and dealmaking because they can't get so-called decisionmakers to decide between the simplest of goddamn tradeoffs to priortize work.

*insert a little comic or written transcript about using index cards to decide between A or B and a pouty stakeholder wanting both, possibly with "before agile" and "after agile" scenarios*

That might just be experience talking, or maybe it's the way I like to learn, I dunno, but it's worked pretty well for me. I haven't hit any home runs in my career by any means, but I'm proud of the base hits and even a couple of doubles. Designing useful things that get acquired, cofounding companies, going through YC, etc. I like to think I know what I'm doing while also staying hungry for new methods.

A better explanation of what I was trying to say above is [Paula Scher's quote](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2292-another-thing-they-dont-teach-you-in-design-s) on collaboration and communication as the real work of a designer.

*Give this a Pictory-style cool treatment?*

Or maybe another quote about ["the only real plan is to learn as you go"](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1707-the-only-plan-is-to-learn-as-you-go)
