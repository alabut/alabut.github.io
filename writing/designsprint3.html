                            <p>I first ran one of these sessions at a conference I organized called Toolbox and then later while my company was in the Y Combinator Summer 2012 session. It's a great way to validate potential designs in a fast-paced environment and I thought the timing was right for Zapier to do a session as well.</p>

                            <p>But before I get into the format of a new and improved version of design sprints, let's examine what kind of problems it solves.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #1: Startups Have No Time</h2>
  

                            <p>The main reason I've found this technique to be so useful is because the types of high-pressure environments I’ve worked in can't take off a week (or even just a few days!) from their usual work to do a longer design sprint, the kind practiced by Google Ventures and explained in <a href="#">their book.</a></p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">It's impossible for most startups to press pause on the entire company for a week, no matter how much design debt they've accrued. A long afternoon meeting is all they can realistically handle.</p>
                            
                            <p>Yet at the same time, startups are exactly the kind of teams that are most in need of solid product direction, especially at the exploratory early stages. The typically frenetic and chaotic pace of feature development inevitably runs into avoidable pot holes and potentially fatal cul de sacs. So how do you reconcile the massive design needs with the utter lack of time?</p>
                            
                            <p>The answer is: <strong>don't try to cram a week's worth of design activities into less time.</strong> Instead, be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and design insights.</p>


                            <p>That's exactly what the mini sprint format does with nothing more than markers, paper, and a stopwatch. It's a more efficient way to get the core benefit of a much longer design sprint. All you really want to do is ilicit the best ideas from every team member and synthesize them into concrete product directions.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #2: Design Expertise Is Earned, Not Crowdsourced</h2>
<p>[Something something about how damn hard it already is to be a designer, often a lone wolf type outnumbered by engineers and others. No need to make it even harder by asking them to do the core parts of your job.... how silly it is to get everyone to learn all the design techniques, just as silly as if the entire company learned sales techniques for a week. How about this controversial idea: just do your damn job! Don't be like that carpenter on Seinfeld that drove Jerry nuts with a million questions about every single damn decision to be made. Show your expertise by collecting input and using your best judgement on which problems are the most pressing, what the underlying issues really are, and possible solutions.]</p>
                            
                            <p class="blockquote filled">I'm not sure I'm feeling this section. I mean, I've advocated in the past for everyone seeing usability testing videos and etc, so saying that people should mind their business feels at odds with asking for respect.</p>



<p>It's especially useful for designers outnumbered by a much larger team of engineers, sales, customer support, and various other stakeholders, all with their unique backgrounds and hunches for product improvements. You're not going to get them all to down tools for a work week and play artsy games with post-its and crayons, nor can you process everyone's input at all times without losing your mind. What you need is a way to harness the firehose in a short manageable burst: get all the ideas that have been pent up throughout the team and crowdsource various design approaches in a parallel manner.</p>

                            <p>In short, you promote yourself to being a design manager for a day and deputize everyone else into being temporary designers, creating work in bulk that you then vet and synthesize into possible design projects for later.</p>

                            <p>Being the only designer at an early stage company is exceedingly difficult. You can go mad trying to strike a balance between being in an overly reactive mode and trying to create visuals for all of the various ideas without much thought, like a design monkey randomly throwing mud on the wall to see what sticks, versus being overly proactive and prescriptive with only a solipsistic approach to which ideas get design help, becoming a bottleneck for the entire company.</p>

                            <p>What you want to do is to strike a balance between accepting divergent trains of thought and synthesizing down to only the best or most achievable ideas. I.e. to get everyone's best ideas but also have a modicum of vetting so that... [Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.]</p>

                            <h2>Problem #2: Execution Trumps &ldquo;Design&nbsp;Thinking&rdquo;</h2>

                            <p>The underlying reason why startups don't have time is actually pretty rational: staying busy is a survival mechanism.</p>

                            <p>The opposite of getting shit done isn't necessarily calm and reflective thought, peppered with smart writing and interesting doodles that culminate in brilliant insights. Ha! <em>If only.</em></p>

                            <p>In the real world, the opposite of productivity is wielding a Sharpie while going in circles with endless debates and losing momentum on feature work, more often than not. So better to stay busy getting measurable work done than vascillate in circles, or at least the thinking goes.</p>

                            <p>And let's be real, pointless vascillation is <em>exactly</em> what design exercises look like to people from traditional business or engineering backgrounds. Or hell, just even everyday normal civilians.</p>

                            <p>Stickies, whiteboard doodles, giant markers, weirdly scripted interactions called &ldquo;user testing&rdquo; that treat valuable customers like lab mice... <strong>they're all insanely valuable tools that I love using.</strong> Hell, I've been running usability tests for <em>two decades.</em> The first book I bought with my first paycheck at my first web gig was <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/books/designing-web-usability/">Designing Web Usability,</a> the Jakob Nielsen classic.</p>

                            <p>But I live in the real world and recognize that these techniques are completely unfamiliar and stangely childish for most non-designers, so they have to be used at the right times and only as needed. Crowdsourcing design expertise isn't the way to gain respect or a seat at the grownups table. That comes from understanding business needs, engineering constraints, the customer support backlog, and a million other things.</p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">To regular people, asking them to take a week to play with kindergarten-style toys is an absolute non-starter that will get you laughed out of the room.</p>

                            <p>You might as well turn down the lights, put on some crappy world music and scroll through random nature scenes while asking whether the design should feel like a leopard or a butterfly. Maybe a rhinoceros? 🤣</p>

                            <p>If you think that's harsh, I'm about to double down and attack one of the sacred cows of the business world, a place where every designer thinks they do their best thinking and claim it as their unique pulpit to hold court in front of, their holy ground, the primary domain where &ldquo;design thinking&rdquo; unveils its infinite wisdown... whiteboards. Yes, whiteboards.</p>

                            <p>What's wrong with whiteboards? It's not just a tool for designers, it's how everyone collaborates, right?</p>

                            <p>Brainstorming via whiteboards is usually seen as an indispensable technique for businesses to discuss strategy, hash out ideas, or nail to specific designs. It's even glamorized in movies and TV whenever a geeky hero has a sudden insight—they'll grab a sharpie and start writing to capture their eureka moment.</p>

                            <p>Don't get me wrong, I love the things. I feel like I can hardly think without one in the room and an office without one looks strangely naked, like it's missing desks and chairs or something.</p>

                            <p><strong>Here's how much I love whiteboards:</strong> I once took a freelance gig at a large, boring and super corporate company just because they used whiteboards to line all of the interior walls. They'd hired an architect that designed the original Facebook campus and created the most beautiful endless ocean of white I'd ever seen. It was <em>just begging</em> to be filled up with ideas.</p>

                            <p>The job sucked but the office completely seduced me. I still daydream about it sometimes.</p>

                            <p>But as much as I love whiteboards, <strong>it turns out that the reality is a bit more nuanced when it comes to how useful they actually are.</strong></p>

                            <p>One of the dirty secrets of business is that it's <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-book-review/">90 percent execution</a>. Success is less about inspiration or random strategizing than it is just plain getting shit done, even at startups. Especially at startups, actually.</p>
                            
                            <p>It doesn't matter whether we're talking about companies that are small or large, remote or in one location, at an early exploratory stage or later growth rounds, have green logos or blue... The hard truth is that all truly effective teams are stocked full of high performing "<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">armies of one</a>" that are mostly busy coming up with and implementing creative solutions, rather than using creativity to generate stunningly original ideas for work.</p>

                            <p>It makes sense, right? Just like every soccer team needs a blend of artists and soliders, you can't afford to have a company filled only with "creative" types; visionary daydreamers making academic arguments all day.

                            <p>You need people to respond to customer needs, explore ideas by building possible solutions and keep up momentum by iterating on whatever worked. You need people that can soldier on and learn by doing.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #3: Groupthink</h2>

                            <p>So whiteboarding isn't as key as we might think and might be a distraction if you overdo it, but that's not even the worst of it. The single most insidious aspect of a typical whiteboard session is groupthink.</p>

                            <p>Even under ideal conditions - everyone has a Sharpie, no one is a wallflower and the team is working together well, with respect and energy - it still doesn't change the fact that they're working on a single canvas, which is prone to creating consensus around a lowest common denominator solution.</p>

                            <p>A more typical whiteboarding scenario is even worse and often has just one speaker and many listeners. <em>"Whoever holds the Sharpie holds the floor"</em> is great for filibusters but isn't the most collaborative format.</p>

                            <p>Don't just take my word for it, look at the science — there are research studies backing this up. Groupthink is the most common team dynamic and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the results are inferior to solitary thought by individuals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In other words, whiteboards don't scale very well.</strong> An individual thinking through ideas by themselves is fine, two or three people hashing out a single idea is problematic, and trying to engage an entire team is almost impossible.</p>
                            
                            <p>

                            </p>

                            <p>And finally, to top it all off, there's one last practical drawback of ideas on whiteboards: they're not easily versioned or archived. Once you've wiped away some ink, it's gone forever. Even capturing it on your phone isn't that great, since it's never the same fidelity as the original and usually squirreled away on a single person's device.</p>


                            <h2>Format</h2>

                            <p>So that's enough about the problems of longer design sprints and the team dynamics of typical brainstorming with brainstorms. What's a possible solution? How can a quick group meeting with paper be any better?</p>

                            <p>If any of the problems I've described resonate with you, then I suggest that every once in a while, say a couple of times a year, try to mix up your usual routine and block out an afternoon to give this mini sprint exercise a whirl. You might be pleasantly surprised at what you can get done!</p>

                            <p><strong>All you need is paper, markers, a stopwatch and 90 minutes of free time.</strong></p>

                            <h3>Setup &amp; Prep</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Split into teams and select topics</em></li></ul>

                            <p>On a Sunday afternoon during our week-long retreat, I introduced myself as moderator and got the session started.</p>

                            <p>I fired up a short slideshow to explain the format of the design session and list a handful of topics that had been floating around our Slack channels as potential projects. We voted for the top three and split into teams, with one project as the focus for each group.</p>

                            <h3>Three Rounds Of Sketching &amp; Presentations</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Each with a different format.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Now our small company was ready for a highly structured session of sketching and brainstorming.</p>

                            <p>We did three rounds of activity. Each round was 10 minutes long, with 5 minutes of sketching designs on the pads and 5 minutes of discussion.</p>

                            <p>Here’s the really important bit: <strong>every round has a different format and includes buffers for silent reflective time,</strong> in order to stimulate individual thought and avoid groupthink.</p>

                            <h3>1st Round: Silent Sketching Of 6 Ideas</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Time: 10 minutes (5 min sketching + 5 min discussion)</em></li>
<li><em>Goal: divergent thought — create many different approaches.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Every person sketched silently by themselves without talking to anyone and jotted down their initial ideas.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="https://www.classicist.org/assets/images/articles/_crop32/GroupSketch_1_photocredit_PeterOlson.jpg"></p>

                            <p>To help them come up with several concepts and not get locked into a single approach,  I had everyone do what’s called a 6-up by dividing their first paper into six evenly-sized boxes,  which they had to try to fill up with as many different concepts as possible.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8069/8244486731_6ca1d0a95a_b.jpg"></p>

                            <p>Sketching 6-ups is one of those ingeniously simple techniques that I use all the time to come up with new ideas and love sharing with others. What makes it so stimulating is that you get the obvious ideas out of your system first, which then forces you to stretch the mental muscles a bit to fill the remaining boxes.</p>

                            <p>Then at the end of the 5 minutes, each subteam got 5 minutes total for each member to take a minute to describe the various ideas they had.</p>

                            <p><strong>The point of this round is to cast a wide net for different approaches.</strong> Silently scribbling out a grid of thumbnails is a powerful method for generating unexpected ideas, especially at the group level. E.g. even a relatively small team of 9 will create 54 separate visuals! As a designer or moderator, you're pretty much guaranteed to find at least a few really interesting needles in that large of a haystack.</p>

                            <h3>2nd Round: Incorporate Feedback</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Time: 10 minutes (5 min sketching + 5 min discussion)</em></li>
<li><em>Goal: balancing divergent thought and convergent decisions - keep brainstorming and yet also identify the most promising ideas.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Everyone went back to 5 minutes of sketching alone without talking again, but this time with new instructions: they were required to steal at least one idea from one of their team members that they had just heard about.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546016366-bf061374d54e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1300&amp;q=80"></p>

                            <p>Then the subteams got another 5 minutes for everyone to share their work. The focus of this round was to begin to switch from divergence to convergence - to start picking the best ideas from the crop and evolving them.</p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">In practice, the ideas are firing rapidly and it’s hard to get people to shut up at the end of the 5 minutes to move on to the next round. That’s a good sign! It means the ideas are flowing.</p>


                            <h3>3rd round: Group Brainstorming &amp; Design Decisions</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Time: 10 minutes (simultaneous sketching &amp; discussion)</em></li>
<li><em>Goal: converge on design decisions.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>For the final round of sketching, the sub-teams now had a new task. Instead of sketching individually without talking, they had to do the exact opposite: now they had to sketch a single set of interfaces as a group and talk their way into consensus.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" src="http://www.servicedesigntools.org/sites/default/files/res_images/GROUP_SKETCHING.jpg"></p>

                            <h3>Final Presentations</h3>

                            <ul><li><em>Time: 30+ minutes (each group presents for 5 min + gets 5 min of feedback)</em></li>
<li><em>Goal: revel in the design glory that is a mini sprint.</em></li></ul>

                            <p>Then comes the fun part - seeing what everyone came up with. The sub-teams all presented to the rest of the company and got insights into the different projects.</p>

                            <p>Ah, maybe this is the section where I talk about how many times I've run this before and use Zapier as a mini case study.

                            <p>The rest of the Zapier team seem to really like it too and came out of the session buzzing with good ideas.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block grayscale" alt="Picture of various paper sketches" src="https://zapier.cachefly.net/storage/photos/c422be9b76e6ccc754ad061cc071b5ae.jpg"></p>

                            <p>I find that people gravitate towards the sub-teams they're most familiar with and bring ideas they've already been chewing over for a while. For example, Zapier's support team had a lot of thoughts to share about the onboarding process, the developers clustered together to talk about third-party integrations, and marketing folks tackled app discovery.</p>

                            <p>So there was at least one person on each sub-team that was involved in implementing these ideas in related future projects.</p>

                            <h2>Benefits</h2>

                            <p>Even after all of this information, you might still be asking: <em>is that all there is, just paper and timed rounds? Is this really better than typical brainstorming? Can this actually deliver deep insights? Is this the one true design exercise to rule them all?</em></p>

                            <p>Those are fair questions and to be honest, you really just should try it to see if it works for you and even then, it still might not be to your taste. That's ok! Every team is unique and all designers have their own idiosyncratic approaches.</p>

                            <p>But since I'm such a big fan and have had great results with it, let's go even deeper on why this technique works so well compared to other design exercises or brainstorming techniques, in my opinion.</p>

                            <p>A mini sprint can...</p>

                            <ul class="double-entry-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Simultaneously create divergent ideas and convergent decisions.</strong>
                                    Typically, idea generation is diametrically opposed to synthesis. This new technique would have to both come up with a variety of ideas as well as organize them without spinning off into useless orbits, which are often opposing goals.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Balance individual contribution with group insights.</strong>
                                    The technique is an automatic failure if it’s no better than just thinking about a problem by yourself or going with the lowest common denominator from the crowd.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Quickly express visual ideas.</strong>
                                    It must be visual instead of mainly text so that it’s not in danger of turning into  <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/archives/001050.php">a boring functional spec with an illusion of agreement.</a> Rough little drawings can done rapidly and ideas can be expressed fast enough to evolve them in a loose conversational manner.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Be extremely multi-threaded. </strong>
                                    It would be ideal to crank through ideas for several projects simultaneously, rather than walking through each concept linearly.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Be easily archived. </strong>
                                    Using paper instead of whiteboards makes it ideal for flipping back through past ideas, instead of being stuck on a single drawing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Be a fun exercise instead of a painful debate. </strong>
                                    There’s a reason why everyone feels comfortable grabbing sharpies and drawing rough sketches, regardless of how effective the end outcomes might actually be, so anything to replace it has to be equally approachable and engaging. Which means it also has to be something everyone can do themselves, without a designer to visualize the hard parts.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
                            <p>So that’s how you run one of these suckers. Whether it’s called a mini sprint, design studio, visual brainstorming or just plain sketching, I haven’t seen this exact format discussed much online. That’s a shame, since it’s super unique and a bit of a hidden gem in my designer’s toolkit.</p>
                            <p>This is one of my favorite methods for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions bursting with ideas for design work and you probably will too.</p>
