                            <h3>Agile Spinoff</h3>

                            <p>Designers have been working within a sprint format on engineering-centric teams for a long time, well before the term became popular, but what brought the term to the tipping point of broad awareness is the particular format popularized by Google Ventures and <a href="#">their book documenting the process.</a></p>

                            </p>

                            <p>Design sprints have a few similarities to the version for developers:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Work is highly atomized and timeboxed to less than a week</li>
                                <li>Concrete outcomes decided in advance</li>
                                <li>Collaborative approach between various roles</li>
                                <li>Transparency into technical tasks and progress</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It’s easy to see why the practice has such widespread appeal. It’s easy to learn, emphasizes collaboration, shortcuts engineering overhead with testable prototypes that force you out of the building, and focuses on execution within a specific timeframe, compared to the vague and hand wavy principles of <a href="#">“design thinking”</a>.</p>

                            <p>Designers earlier in the career (or new to startups and product work, as opposed to agencies and branding) seem to particularly benefit from it, from what I’ve gleaned from conversations on Twitter and popular forums like <a href="#">Designers Guild.</a> A well-documented process is fantastic for those early in the skill acquisition phase of their career, the same way that I absolutely loved the UX workshops by the highly influential and now defunct Adaptive Path when I was first starting out.</p>

                            <p>Still, I remember being a bit surprised when design sprints first started to get popular. I remember thinking, <em>doesn’t everyone know this stuff already?</em></p>

                            <p>I'm not saying good design and UX principles are universal these days, just that the tools for tackling those challenges seem pretty well documented. It's not like design sprints are bringing awareness to new techniques like when the UX field was first starting up. Design sprints sounded like just a timeboxed remix of typical best practices wrapped up in new packaging: group brainstorming, usability tests, quick prototypes, etc. Basic stuff taught in any school or bootcamp these days, and very easy to pick up for the self-taught types like myself.</p>

                            <p><strong>In fact, I should be exactly the target audience for a fast and wide-ranging approach like this:</strong> a designer from a technical background that's super familiar with developers, agile techniques, and working on fast teams.</p>

                            <p>Being a designer at startups is particularly challenging and takes a specific kind of attitude, whether learned or acquired. A sort of punk rock level of independence that doesn't mind being a lone wolf fastly outnumbered by engineers and business types. I'll check out anything that's down with the cause of making design faster and purports to have even more experience with startups than I do.</p>

                            <p>It’s an admirable goal for Google Ventures to be inspired by the challenges of early stage startups and come up with new techniques for designers to be more nimble and execution-oriented. But without getting into the age-old debate on the drawbacks of agile, it reminds me of a paraphrased version of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems/">an old saying about regular expressions:</a></p>

                                <p>Some designers struggle to keep up with developers and think <em>“I know, I’ll make our design process more like agile&nbsp;development.”</em></p>

                            <p>Ok, so putting aside concerns about agile development that everyone might not be aware of, design sprints still sound great. Actually they sound kind of fun. So who wouldn’t like that?</p>

                            <p>I’m sure every process has its detractors and it’s not a fit for every situation, so that’s to be expected and perfectly normal. All I knew personally is that I felt a need to document my own process because I had misgivings about the week-long version and wanted to think through why that was.</p>

                            <p>Then I found out that I’m not the only one with reservations after privately quizzing a few well-respected friends to get their candid takes. I thought maybe it was just the teams I was used to - super scrappy seed stage startups - but pinging others made me realize it might be more about the experience level of the designer than the situation.</p>

                            <h3>All Advice Is Relative <a name="relative"></a></h3>

                            <p>Just to be clear, it’s not that I’m completely against agile development, design sprints, or any other techniques. In fact, quite the opposite - I'm a process omnivore and devoured as many as I could when I was figuring out my own approach. I tried many different things, stole the bits that worked for me and never stayed wedded to any one single approach.</p>

                            <p>Having an eclectic appetite has worked pretty well for me over the years. I haven't hit any home runs by any means, but I am proud of the base hits in my career: designing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/14/cake-financial-acquired-etrade/">useful things</a> that <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubicon-project-acquires-isocket-and-shiny-ads-282920711.html">get acquired</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/referly-1m/">cofounding companies</a>, going through <a href="https://ycombinator.com">the world's most prestigious startup incubator</a>, and generally surviving and thriving in the ever-changing world of tech. I like to think that means I know what I'm doing while also staying hungry for new methods.</p>
 
                            <p>A more ambidexturous approach to process might be a personality thing but I'm pretty sure it's also a function of seniority. When you’re experienced enough, you’ll have learned different methodologies over time and picked the bits out that work for you to form your own flexible and idiosyncratic methods that play to your unique strengths.</p>

                            <p>So like a workplace version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect">the Rashomon effect</a>, what I’m saying is that “good process” is relative and not everything is a universal truth.

                            <h3>Who Design Sprints Are Really For <a name="who"></a></h3>

                            <p>Regardless of experience or preferred approach, there’s one thing you learn pretty quickly when creating your own workflow from different techniques: there’s what a methodology says it’ll do and <em>what it actually does.</em></p>

                            <p>For example, it's a recurring joke that <strong>extremely regimented and formal versions of an agile process make a development team anything but agile.</strong> That's for a good reason, since agile is really about expectation management for stakeholders and avoiding executive randomization of engineering pipelines.</p>

                            <p>Simlarly, design sprints might not be about producing amazing design work as much as it is about establishing respect for designers and their various techniques.</p>

                            <p style="display: none;"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3a64b429382574bb684bbbefb8b7563d"></p>

                            <blockquote class="blockquote filled whitebox">
                                <p><strong>So let’s get real - design sprints are more about selling a long term process to stakeholders than creating the best short term results for the team.</strong></p>
                                <p><em>(Plus also maybe teaching the basics of design methods and communication skills to inexperienced designers.)</em></p>
                            </blockquote>


                            <p>Design sprints are more about generating buy-in for common best practices so that stakeholders and engineers will be understanding about the time and research it actually takes to cook up decent designs, instead of rushed work that might not solve underlying UX issues. It's much like the way agile development uses transparency into engineering tasks to buy enough time to do development with little or no technical debt, as opposed to the fragile and smelly code base that comes from constantly switching goals at an executive whim.</p>

                            <p>A secondary goal is to act as a communication bootcamp for inexperienced designers to learn how to lead teams proactively instead of reactively creating whatever’s dicated to them. I.e. to independently think through problems rather than simply throwing mud on the wall because of <a href="https://outline.com/SumnzP">"the hippo" - the highest paid person's opinion.</a></p>

                            <p>All of this means you should temper your expectations about actual design work because you probably won't emerge from one of these things with a prototype that’ll save the business, for example.</p>

                            <p>Which is totally fine! But also what makes it not a fit for a lot of teams, ones with designers that already know when to use the right tools and in self-sufficient ways that don’t slow everyone down.</p>

                            <p>Ok, having said all that, let’s go deeper on the logistical drawbacks of why a week-long sprint is a non-starter in many situations.</p>

                            <h3>Startups Have No Time</h3>

                            <p><em>(And pretty much no one else does either…)</em></p>

                            <p>The main reason I started using a 90 minute technique is because the types of high-pressure environments I’ve worked in can’t take off a week (or even just a few days!) from their usual work to do a longer design sprint, the kind practiced by Google Ventures and explained in <a href="#">their book.</a></p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">It’s impossible for most teams to press pause for an entire week, no matter how dire their design debt.</p>

                            <p>Yet at the same time, the kind of early stage startups I’m most familiar with are exactly the teams that are most in need of solid product direction. The frenetic pace of feature development combines with the exploratory nature of a company’s early days in an explosive way. Startups inevitably run into avoidable pot holes and even potentially fatal cul de sacs because of their overwhelming emphasis on momentum.</p>

                            <p>So how do you reconcile the massive design needs with the utter lack of time?</p>

                            <p>The answer is not to cram a week’s worth of design activities into less time, <strong>it’s simply to use the right tools at the right time, as you go along.</strong> </p>

                            <p>Designing humane products and apps while having effective collaboration is a mindset and active part of the work culture, not a one time fix.</p>

                            <p style="background-color: red;"><em>NOTE: </em>Find better tweet example for design as an ongoing process...</p>

                            <p>And when it comes to team exercises, be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and design insights, since a long afternoon meeting is all your team can realistically handle for any one technique, whether that’s user testing, brainstorming with sketches, or what have you.</p>

                            <p>Especially when it comes to exercises that are meant to coax out the collective knowledge of a team, all you really want is to stimulate the best ideas from every team member and synthesize them into concrete product directions. All the other techniques in a design sprint are ones that a self-sufficient designer should be able to carry out in parallel, whether solo or by pairing up with devs and PMs, so why waste everybody’s time with esoteric techniques?</p>

                            <p>Group insights and consensus is exactly what the mini sprint format generates with nothing more than markers, paper, and a stopwatch. It’s a more efficient way to get what I consider to be the core benefit of a much longer design sprint.</p>

                            <p style="background-color: red;"><em>NOTE: </em>Move the paragraphs above into the section introing my technique, right before getting into details about the format.</p>

                            <h3>An Afternoon = Realistic Timeframe <a name="timeframe"></a></h3>

                            <p>And to jump to the punchline of what’s worked for me instead, I’ve found that the best format to bring the whole team together to get their best thinking is a long afternoon meeting, regardless of the particular topic or design exercise.</p>

                            <blockquote class="blockquote filled">
                                <p>Anything longer than the length of a movie is a corporate group therapy session disguised as real work.</p>
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>For brainstorming, that’s just enough time to clear the air and vent any pent-up ideas before discussing more experimental solutions. For usability tests, it’s enough time to watch a session and discuss the lessons learned afterwards. So on and so forth.</p>

                            <h3>Execution Trumps Strategizing <a name="execution"></a></h3>

                            <p>The underlying reason why startups don’t have time is actually pretty rational and applies to most other company types too: <strong>staying busy is a survival mechanism.</strong> People try to stay busy shipping meaningful work, otherwise they risk stagnation at best and existential threats at worst.</p>

                            <p>One of the dirty secrets of business is that <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-book-review/">work is 90 percent execution</a>. Success is less about inspiration or random strategizing than it is just plain getting shit done, day after day. Even at startups. Especially at startups, actually.</p>

                            <p>It doesn’t matter whether we’re talking about companies that are large or small, remote or co-located, have green logos or blue… The hard truth is that all truly effective teams are stocked full of high performing <a href="https://37signals.com/svn/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one">“armies of one”</a> that are mostly busy coming up with and implementing creative solutions, rather than using creativity to generate stunningly original ideas for work.</p>

                            <p>It makes sense, right? You can’t afford to have a company filled only with “visionary” types, daydreamers making academic arguments all day. You need people that can soldier on and learn by doing.</p>

                            <p>You need both modes of work - productivity and reflection - but that doesn’t mean equal amounts of time or a rigid schedule for each. Everyone has find their own rhythm for avoiding too much action without thought or thought without action. </p>

                            <p>In the real world, strategy sessions are often the opposite of productivity. Sharpie showdowns at the whiteboard, going in circles with endless debates, all while losing momentum on shipping meaningful work. Meeting hell. Vascillating ad nauseam.</p>

                            <p><strong>Good designers abhor vascilattion. They keep up momentum and maybe even make teams faster, not drag them down.</strong></p>

                            <p>I guess you could say that an emphasis on speed, independence and most of all, a high quality end product is my version of <a href="#">Dieter Rams' rules for good design.</a> So in my experience, a good designer knows how to make their own prototypes, trawl through support requests to understand customer needs, do competitive analysis, prioritize feature work, and countless other things without having to stop for guidance at every step. They keep their powder dry on group collaboration techniques so that they only gather the entire team when absolutely necessary and for the minimum time possible, to respect their colleagues' time and energy.</p>

                            <h3>Design Exercises Look Like Kindergarten Nonsense <a name="kindergarten"></a></h3>

                            <p>While we're at it, let’s also be real about how design exercises come across to most people.</p>

                            <p><strong>Design exercises intended for collaboration look exactly like pointless vacillation to engineers or business types.</strong> Or hell, just even everyday normal civilians.</p>

                            <p>Stickies, whiteboard doodles, giant markers, weirdly scripted interactions that treat valuable customers like lab mice… they’re all insanely valuable tools that I love using. Hell, I’ve been running usability tests for <em>two decades.</em> The first book I bought with my first paycheck at my first gig out of college was <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/books/designing-web-usability/">Designing Web Usability,</a> the Jakob Nielsen classic.</p>

                            <p>But I live in the real world and recognize that these techniques are completely unfamiliar and stangely childish for most non-designers, so they have to be used as needed on a project and definitely not all at once as a substitute for critical thought. That’s my usual assumption: everyone else is just too damn busy with spinning their own plates to stop and do my job for me.</p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">Regular people are busy doing their jobs and want designers to just get on with doing theirs too, not to push the esoteric details of their internal methods on to everyone else.</p>

                            <p>It’s an absolute non-starter to ask most teams to pause their work for a week to play with kindergarten-style toys just so you can figure out what the hell to work on and how to test its efficacy. It will get you laughed out of the room!</p>

                            <p>You might as well turn down the lights, put on some crappy world music and scroll through random nature scenes while asking whether the design should feel like a leopard or a butterfly.</p>

                            <h3>You Can’t Crowdsource Expertise <a name="expertise"></a></h3>

                            <p>Playing with crayons and crowdsourcing product decisions by voting with post-its isn’t the best way to show design expertise anyway.</p>

                            <p class="blockquote filled">You'll get respect if you respect other people’s challenges <em>— their business needs, engineering constraints, customer support backlog, and a thousand other things —</em> all without bringing the whole team to a stop.</p>

                            <p>Gaining respect comes from understanding everyone else’s needs, on the fly and under massive time pressures.</p>

                            <p>And most of all, respect comes from doing great work. You might not always get credit for nailing a design but guess who gets the blame if you throw every single idea into a blender and call it a group decision? Not the team or process. <em>They’ll blame you, the designer.</em> And rightly so - you’re supposed to be the arbiter of team input that distills down disparate needs into distinctly understandable visuals, not a hoarder that throws every idea into a junk drawer.</p>

                            <p><strong>Good designs are hard decisions made visual - don’t shirk the responsibility under the guise of collaboration.</strong> Otherwise you’re no better than a PM or technical lead desperately cobbling together wireframes out of random design kits.</p>

                            <p>It's a critical skill for designers to think for themselves amidst the pressure of being vastly outnumbered by other roles. The stakes are high. It’s about more than just doing good individual work, it’s setting the bar for expected product quality for everyone and avoiding the lowest common denominator outcomes.</p>

                            <p>Don’t just take my word for it, look at the science — there are research studies backing this up. Groupthink is the most common team dynamic and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer">the results are inferior to solitary thought by individuals.</a></p>

                            <ol>
                            <li><strong>Use an “unprocess”.</strong> Pick the right tools at the right time and in a self-sufficient manner, rather than a regimented formal schedule.</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep up team momentum.</strong> Bring everyone in short bursts rather than extended sprints.</li>
                            <li><strong>Understand everyone else’s needs</strong> rather than pushing design methods on other people to understand your goals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoid groupthink.</strong> Don’t shirk hard decisions for the sake of consensus, or you’ll just make lowest common denominator Frankenstein designs.</li>

                            <p>That’s why I’ve sought out a better approach for collecting design input, something that’s better than a typical brainstorming session with whiteboards and fits with my approach to teamwork on fast teams that I outlined above.</p>

                            <p style="background-color: red;"><em>NOTE: </em>[insert a link to Will Evans? something about how I first heard about it from him and it’s worked pretty great in all the years since]</p>

                            <p>I’m not saying I have all the answers, just that people should try something different if they’ve had similar reservations.</p>

                            <p style="background-color: orange;"><strike>Move pro-sprint section to intro?</strike> No! Save it for the end and move the mini sprint out of this article entirely!!!</p>

                            <p style="background-color: red;"><em>NOTE: </em>And also bring in and collect my little "mini sprint" teasers into this section instead. E.g. all you really want from a team exercise etc etc etc</p>

                            <p>If you don’t and you love design sprints, then that’s great! Don’t let me stop you and have fun continuing to practice your craft and learn new skills.</p>

                            <p>Don’t worry about whether the deliverables are world changing or fix all of your business needs in 5 days; think of it more as a team building exercise that indoctrinates the value of design and familiarizes everyone with the tools of the trade. Teamwork is the ultimate end result because the team will still be there while sprints and other techniques come and go, so use whatever means necessary to wear all the different hats that designers are expected to be comfortable with.</p>

                                    Mostly, designers get paid to negotiate the difficult terrain of individual egos, expectations, tastes, and aspirations of various individuals in an organization or corporation, against business needs, and constraints of the marketplace…

                                    Getting a large, diverse group of people to agree on a single new methodology for all of their corporate communications means the designer has to be a strategist, psychiatrist, diplomat, showman, and even a Svengali. The complicated process is worth money. That’s what clients pay for.

                            <p>But if you’re a designer experiencing any of the problems I described about design sprints <em>— if you find yourself chafing under rigid formats like I did with agile when I was starting out, if you like fast teams but all you want is better design input and don’t want the overhead of a dozen different exercises over the course of a week —</em> you should probably experiment with other methods, techniques that are quicker and more flexible.</p>

                            <p>Try to mix things up a bit occasionally with things like the mini sprint described below. Block out an afternoon once in a while (let’s say quarterly or so, whenever you feel like there’s pent up demand for brainstorming) and give this exercise a whirl instead to see how it works for you.</p>

                            <p>So that’s my take on an alternative to design sprints for stimulating collective thought. Whether it’s called a mini sprint, design studio, visual brainstorming or just plain sketching, I haven’t seen this exact format discussed much online. That’s a shame, since it’s a a hidden gem and a super unique part of my designer’s toolkit.</p>

                            <p>Mini sprints are one of my favorite methods for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions with solid design ideas and more importantly, enthusiasm about future projects from the team.</p>
