In Defense Of Paper

or: whiteboarding considered harmful

Cut and paste from design studio post:


First though, let’s examine the problem with traditional brainstorming techniques.

## — Whiteboarding has inherent flaws —
Brainstorming via whiteboards is usually seen as an indispensable technique for businesses to discuss strategy, hash out ideas, or nail to specific designs. It’s even glamorized in movies and TV whenever a geeky hero has a sudden insight—they’ll grab a sharpie and start writing to capture their eureka moment.

The reality is a bit more nuanced than that and in practice, whiteboarding has several flaws that make it less valuable than most people think.

### Remote-Unfriendly
* Why be productive when you can waste time and money on an office?
So do remote companies like Zapier miss out on this team dynamic? Or is whiteboarding one of the many intangible reasons why teams still colocate together.

It turns out neither is true. One of the dirty secrets of business (even startups) is that it’s 90 percent execution and is less about inspiration or random strategizing. Constant whiteboarding is a sign of a distraction, not of productivity. Our team is comprised of “armies of one” that are responsible for generating ideas for work but most of the time are busy getting things done.

### Grains Of Sand
* Here Today, Gone Tomorrow
One practical matter is that whiteboarding is not versioned—once you’ve wiped away some ink, it’s gone forever. Even capturing it on your phone isn’t that great, since it’s never the same fidelity as the original and usually squirreled away on a single person’s device.

### We Don’t Serve Introverts Here
* An Organized Shouting Match
Another problem is that whiteboarding doesn’t capture the input of the full team and is especially harmful to thoughtful introverts. A messy whiteboard with overlapping spaghetti noodles in every direction might *look* collaborative, but it’s often just business theatrics masquerading as productivity and consensus. The reality is that the loudest one wielding the Sharpie wins.

### Groupthink Made Visual
* Who needs independent thought?

And the absolute worst, most insidious aspect of constant group brainstorming is that it falls for a cognitive trap: groupthink. Even if everyone has a Sharpie and is working together, including the introverts, it still doesn’t solve the problem of groupthink, since they’re working on a single whiteboard to create consensus around a lowest common denominator.

There’s even research studies backing this up—groupthink is the typical team dynamic and the results are inferior to solitary thought by individuals.

So what’s the solution? It’s a simple exercise that requires notebooks and pens, a stopwatch and a few ground rules.
