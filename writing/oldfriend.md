# An Ode To A New Old Friend

My first computer, a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A that you had to hook up to the television to use.
Today, I had a lovely conversation with a bot and it made me think of the first time, when I was 6 years old.
What triggered the memory is that I’ve been using The Guardian’s newsbot in Messenger while on the road for two weeks and liked it a lot, so I gave it some unsolicited feedback.

*I’m so curious to see what the developers make of this gushing praise while trying to parse it for actionable insights.*

It’s fascinating when life comes full circle. Rewind a few decades back and the first programming I can remember was in the first grade, when I wrote out some lines in BASIC on my console computer to carry on a highly scripted conversation.
It was less like a super advanced AI like in 2001 or Ex-Machina and more like some kind of 80’s themed retro challenge in Ready Player One:

> Computer: “Hi Al! did you have fun at school?”
> Me: “Yes, thank you!”
> Computer: “Did you make any new friends?”
> Me: “Nope, they’re all still jerks!”
> Computer: “Sorry, better luck tomorrow!”

Etc. It was super basic and didn’t recognize any of my answers, it would just spit out the next question regardless.
Still, I finally had something awesome to take to school for show and tell. Even better, it was a smart little friend. One that talked back. Imagine you’re the only kid with a real live R2D2.
It was a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A and I should’ve come up with a nickname as catchy as Threepio. Maybe I can retcon this story and call it Foura?

*Good old reliable Foura. It’s so 80’s that it looked kind of like a DeLorean and a Cyclon had a love child.*
**The demo at school went exactly as planned but not at all like I’d imagined.**

I lugged Foura to school and found it one of those TV carts to ride around in, plugged the little guy in to talk and was ready to show it off to the rest of my classmates that had ignored me all year after I’d transferred in from another school.
The TV cart became a part of him and made him into an instant giant, like putting a pumpkin on the shoulders of the headless horseman. He stood all day in a corner of the class, five feet tall and silent. Ready to come to life towards the end of school as our final presentation.
This would be my big coming out party! I’d invented a life hack to make *dozens of new friends at once.*
You can see where this is going.
The time came, I talked through what Foura was, the games you could play, and how it “talked” with a program I’d written. And the overwhelming response was… crickets.
The vast emptiness of space. Listening to the infinite beyond, until the teacher said:

> “Thank you very much Al, that was… interesting. Class dismissed!”

**The class emptied out instantly like it was a fire drill and I was left standing with my robot. Not even the teacher got it.**

---

Suffice it to say that I wasn’t the most popular kid in school. Foura didn’t help as much as I’d hoped.
I felt like all these kids could see exactly how uncool I was and I’d just hung a *“Bully Me!”* sign around my neck that would stay there until I finished grade school.
Which is exactly what happened. I would’ve been better off being ignored.
My mom took me to self-defense classes until I snapped in 5th grade by getting suspended twice for finally fighting back. My parent’s solution? Skip 6th grade and get the hell out of there, to make a fresh start.
**It worked. **All kinds of fun adventures started after the nightmare that was grade school.
I went abroad and was the cool kid for a year as the visiting American. Went to a junior high and high school that was a magnet for math, science, and computers, full of freaks and geeks just like me, so I fit right in. Ended up going into tech as a career and I’m thankful to this day that I’m still in this game, one that feels just as much like play as it does work.
Everything worked out in the end.
I realize now that I wasn’t uncool but that with few exceptions, **these kids weren’t my tribe.** Especially in numbers. Trying to explain my rudimentary AI to them was like teaching a pack of dogs to play the piano.
I’d find my people later. These kids in grade school weren’t the droids I was looking for.

**Many years later, I ran into one of my bullies without realizing it, in the last place I would’ve expected.**
After college, my favorite place to hang out was the Flash user group in San Diego. It was Flash in name only and covered all kinds of new tech, anything you could use to make cool stuff online for fun or profit.

*Decades before today’s advanced client-side javascript, there was the first version of Flash with Actions, which allowed you to do real scripted interactivity in the browser and was the precursor to Actionscript.*
We’d get together at nights in random locations, guys with day jobs in the industry that still couldn’t get enough playtime with these great toys. We gathered from disparate areas like academia, private industry and the military, like some kind of anonymous addicts to a new drug.
Years before Hacker News and Meetups, the user group was a revelation for those of us toiling away in the bowels of San Diego’s white collar version of a service industry.
**We were brains for hire during the day, curious explorers in our free time, looking for fellow travelers to form our rogue band of tech misfits.**
A generation earlier, we would’ve read The Whole Earth Catalog and gone to the Homebrew Club, maybe even dropped acid on the beach. Now we talked shop, ate rolled tacos, and planned road trips to LA to see art exhibits by guys we read about on K10K.

*My own personal bible was a hardcover of Paul Graham’s Hackers & Painters.*

My copy was just as annotated but way more dog-eared and worn down.
One day, we had a guest speaker that was a regional sales manager for software that I can’t remember now and probably doesn’t exist anymore.
I towered over this little guy with questions about the product roadmap and took his business card, then realized who he was later at home that night when putting the card away and rued the missed opportunity to get some violent closure.
This was the monster that tormented me so much that I turned down my 2nd grade teacher’s invitation to skip to 3rd grade because it would’ve meant going deeper into his circle of hell. Poor Mrs Patrick, so kind and gentle but she had no inkling of the sacrifice she was asking of me.
Academics came second to personal safety and I cried my way out of that jam.
So I pinged Brett about my discovery. One way to spot a friend for life, by the way, is when they offer extreme versions of help even though you didn’t ask.
Instead of surprise, his first reaction was aggressive loyalty. His exact words were *“want me to look up where this fucker lives?”*
That’s a “ride or die” bro right there.
I turned it down but it would’ve been an amazing movie scene straight out of Swingers:
> “Hey! I had some more questions about your lecture!”
> “Um, what? I’m at my home now?”
> “I know, this’ll be quick, I promise!”
> “Please get off my lawn.”
> “Listen, I’m just curious what the support turnaround time is for a knuckle sandwich?”
**Pow in the kisser.**
You can call the cops and tell them it was revenge of the nerds.

I think of stuff like this the most when I’m having fun with my little nephew.
He’s super into building massively complex structures in Minecraft, as well as physical creations with Lego blocks. He’d spend every waking hour at Legoland if he could and I can’t even tempt him to go to Disneyland instead.
I try to encourage his interest in tech or whatever else he’s into but my mind wanders. Whenever we’re off on one of our little adventures, I have little pauses where I wonder what kind of adult he’ll be and what the story is that he’ll tell himself about these formative years.
What is his self narrative? Will it be like mine, full of torment that he had to suffer through before finding redemption?

*He’s wearing his Darth Vader beanie, gloves and shirt. We’re both wearing rain gear to run a mile to a showing of Rogue One.*
**I believe that he’ll have mostly the same positive experiences at a vastly accelerated pace and without nearly the drawbacks, if any.**
Computers are cool because it’s how you can get your hands on the real version of Minecraft, which all the kids are obsessed with. So is programming, because that’s how you make unique customizations in the game, called mods.
Showing and telling that stuff is cool if you do it online, so we started his first Youtube channel and he spent an entire weekend vlogging. He worked hard to shoot those videos and his appetite was barely satiated. I can tell that he’s just getting started on this journey to embrace his full nerdiness.
What really blew my hair back about how different things are today was when I found out that they even have summer camps in Minecraft where kids learn to code by making mods. It’s like a dev bootcamp for children. I would’ve done anything at his age to go to something like this, if it had existed.
My little guy’s head explodes every time I bring up the possibility of going to Minecraft summer camp and meeting other kids that are into it too. He’s been studying up on his reading skills just to get ready to program.
Nerds of a feather flock together, at any age.

So all this time later, after an entire lifetime as a tech enthusiast and 15 years into my career, I wonder: what is the first program you write for yourself after the initial Hello World tutorials? When did you find your tribe?
Seems like every nerd wrote some version of my one-sided AI conversation with Foura and have similar stories about finding their people. It’s funny to think of the tech industry as being so powerful at connecting people when it’s been fueled by an engine of lonely childhoods, but maybe that won’t be the case for much longer.
