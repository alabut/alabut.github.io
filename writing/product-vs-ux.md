Product design is pragmatic, UX is academic

Especially at startups, since fast-paced entrepreneurship is for practictioners that get shit done, not theorists that parade around as "idea guys" and visionaries. (steve blank)

Steve Jobs quote or video clip about salespeople and academic types falling in love with process over product.

I get it, it's seductive to focus on craft over the end result. Our idea of being productive is like what you see on TV - lots of whiteboarding and enough stickies to create a life-sized moose out of paper mache.

I used to think there was a nuance to this and that the design exercises taught in school had their place, like in large companies with lots of stakeholders. But that also goes against the grain of the more design-driven businesses, like Apple. They have thousands of employees and the vast majority of them work in small teams.
