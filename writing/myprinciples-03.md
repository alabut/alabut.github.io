# My Work Philosophy

"Great artists imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil."
- W. H. Davenport Adams writing about Alfred Tennyson

I’ve become a pretty good thief over the years. It’s a subtle art to steal various bits of inspiration and then hide the heist, carefully melding the disparate pieces together to form a unique new thing.

I think pretty much every good designer is a thief in that sense, at least when it comes to their design style. But I've also applied that to my workflows and approach.

That's how I've avoided a rigid process for creating products and created a flexible, constantly-evolving set of guiding principles, all of which serve one overarching mission: **to think independently and be tenacious about doing the absolute best work I can.**

# My playbook for kicking ass

1. **Product-Centric Leadership** *Good design means putting the product experience first, no matter the business pressures.*
2. **Opinionated Approach** *Users like obvious actions, teams like clear goals. So do the homework required to have strong convictions.*
3. **Continuous Learning & Adaptability** *Stay flexible and inquisitive.*

## Product-Centric Leadership

I'm proud of my wide-ranging background. I started out studying neuroscience, transitioned to being a developer in academia, then jumped to startups to become a designer, founder and head of product.

The experience has given me a holistic understanding of both product details and overall market context. But no matter which hat I've worn, it's always been in service of one goal: **to make best-in-class products and experiences.**

Here's how I drive the value of design on teams:

- **Product-Led Growth**: Build superior products, ones that meet real user needs with style and grace. I firmly believe that the only real way to achieve sustainable growth is with solid, thoughtful design.

- **Cross-Functional Expertise**: Bridge the gap between design, product, and business. I strive to be a versatile player, equipped to understand and address challenges from multiple angles.
- 
- **Design Leadership**: Champion the importance of design within the organization. Elevate the role of design by demonstrating its impact on business outcomes and driving design-thinking across the team.

## Opinionated Approach

I have always been a person with strong convictions. As long as it's paired with collaboration and reflection, I have confidence that my skills, instincts and insights will drive solid work.

Here's how my opinionated approach manifests in my work:

- **Bold Design Decisions**: Make confident and informed design decisions. I draw on my extensive experience to create designs that I believe in, even if they challenge conventional wisdom.

- **Constructive Disagreement**: Don't shy away from expressing my views or challenging others' ideas when necessary. A diversity of opinions leads to better decisions and more innovative solutions.

- **Experience-Informed Opinions**: Base my strong opinions on deep experience and knowledge. I'm always open to new ideas and feedback, but I also trust my instincts and insights gained from years of experience.

## Continuous Learning & Adaptability

Curiosity is my main personal driver in work and life. That's why I love working in tech: it touches every other industry. Every new product is an opportunity for a journalistic-type of research and learning.

Here's how curiosity helps me stay flexible and keep growing in my work:

- **Growth Mindset**: Maintain a commitment to learning and personal development, regardless of how much experience I have. There's always something new to learn or a fresh perspective to consider.

- **Agile Adaptability**: Stay flexible and responsive to change. In the dynamic world of startups, the ability to adapt and pivot is key.

- **Seeking Challenges**: Embrace difficult problems as opportunities to grow and learn. I don't shy away from complex challenges; instead, I see them as chances to push my boundaries and develop new skills.
