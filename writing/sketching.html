                            <p class="blockquote grayscale-quote"><strong>Note:</strong> I first shared the structured brainstorming technique on <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/run-a-design-studio/">the Zapier company blog,</a> where I referred to it by the earlier name of "design studio".</p>

                            <h4>Setup &amp; Prep</h4>

                            <ul>
                            <li><em>Split into teams and select topics</em></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>First you set things up by giving everyone a quick overview of the process, list some possible topics to work on, and then split into groups to tackle one topic each. </p>

                            <p>People will naturally gravitate towards the sub-teams tackling ideas that they’re most familiar with. That’s great - you want people to bring up problem areas that have been bothering them and pitching potential solutions that they’ve been chewing over already. Plus usually that means there’ll be at least one person on each sub-team that will be involved in implementing any good ideas that turn into future projects.</p>

                            <p>Now you’re ready to start sketching.</p>

                            <h4>Three Rounds Of Sketching &amp; Presentations</h4>

                            <ul>
                            <li><em>Each with a different format.</em></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You’ll do three rounds of activity. Each round is intended to be about 10 minutes long, with 5 minutes of sketching designs on the pads and 5 minutes of discussion. The reality is that the rounds will go long, especially the last one, so it’s more of a target guideline than a strict rule.</p>

                            </p>

<p>The first two include buffers for silent reflective time, in order to stimulate individual thought and avoid groupthink. The group will come together for consensus only at the end, after everyone has done their best thinking and had time to develop their own ideas.</p>

                            <h4>1st Round: Silent Sketching Of 6 Ideas</h4>

                            <ul>
                            <li><em>Time: 10 minutes (5 min sketching + 5 min discussion)</em></li>
                            <li><em>Goal: divergent thought — create many different approaches.</em></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Every person will jot down their initial ideas without talking to anyone else.</p>

                            <p>To help them get the ball rolling and shake out a wide range of initial ideas without falling in love with the first thought they have, I have everyone do what’s called a 6-up. You divide your first paper into six evenly-sized boxes and fill them up with as many different concepts as possible.</p>

                            <p>Sketching 6-ups is one of those ingeniously simple techniques that I use all the time to come up with new ideas and love sharing with others. What makes it so stimulating is that you get the obvious ideas out of your system first, which then forces you to stretch the mental muscles a bit to fill the remaining boxes.</p>

                            <p>Then at the end of the 5 minutes, each subteam got 5 minutes total for each member to take a minute to describe the various ideas they had.</p>

                            <p><strong>The point of this round is to cast a wide net for different approaches.</strong></p>

                            <p>Silently scribbling out a grid of thumbnails is a powerful method for generating unexpected ideas, whether solo or as a group. A relatively small team of 9 drawing 6 sketches each will create 54 separate visuals! You’re pretty much guaranteed to find at least a few really interesting needles in that large of a haystack.</p>

                            <h4>2nd Round: Incorporate Feedback</h4>

                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Time: 10 minutes (5 min sketching + 5 min discussion)</em></li>
                                <li><em>Goal: transition from divergent brainstorming to convergent decisions on the most promising ideas.</em></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Everyone goes back to 5 minutes of sketching alone without talking again, but this time with new instructions: <em>they’re required to steal at least one piece of feedback they got from one of their team members.</em> Then the subteams will get another 5 minutes for everyone to share their work and discuss further.</p>

                            <h3>Results <a name="results"></a></h3>

                            <p>I’ve run these a few times over the years and have had great results each time. The first time I publicly shared my version was at Toolbox, a conference I organized about flexible approaches to product development. I’ve also run it internally on my own product teams, as well as for Y Combinator while my company was in the Summer 2012 batch.</p>

                            <p>I keep coming back to it because it’s such a fun and time-efficient team exercise that people seem to love. It does many things at once, such as uncovering and validating potential design directions, introducing team members to the deceptively powerful technique of rough sketches, and overall acts almost like demographic research for me as a designer, where I can step away from the granular details of a feature or product to distill the collective knowledge embedded throughout a team.</p>

                            <p>This can be especially useful for a fully remote team. For example, after leaving my YC company, I spent a few brief months with our batchmate Zapier and led their team through a quick brainstorming exercise at an annual team retreat in Colorado. It was fun, wide-ranging and a welcome break from implementation and execution. Everyone came out of the session buzzing with good ideas.</p>

                            <p>Even after all of this information, you might still be asking: <em>is that all there is, just paper and timed rounds? Can this actually deliver deep insights? Is this really better than typical brainstorming or a more formal design sprint?</em></p>

                            <p>Those are fair questions and to be honest, it takes such little time to experiment with that you really just should try it to see how it works.</p>

                            <p>But even then it still might not be to your taste. That’s ok! There is no one true design exercise to rule them all. Every team is unique and all designers have their own idiosyncratic approaches.</p>

                            <p>Since I’m such a big fan and have had great results with it, here's my personal take on why this technique has worked so well for me compared to other team brainstorming techniques.</p>

                            <p>A mini sprint can…</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Simultaneously create divergent ideas and convergent decisions.</strong> Typically, idea generation is diametrically opposed to synthesis and getting those two modes confused is one of the most common ways I’ve seen meetings get derailed when discussing design work. It’s really hard to come up with a variety of ideas without spinning off into useless orbits, and then to organize them without shutting down interesting avenues too early. (see <a href="https://www.justinmind.com/blog/double-diamond-model-what-is-should-you-use/">the double diamond process</a> for more background info)</li>
                                <li><strong>Balance individual contribution with group insights.</strong> Any team exercise is an automatic failure if it’s no better than just thinking about a problem by yourself or going with the lowest common denominator from the crowd. It has to be the best of both, or at least be clear about which mode you’re in.</li>
                                <li><strong>Quickly express visual ideas.</strong> It’s a visual technique instead of a writing-centric one so that it’s not in danger of turning into <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/archives/001050.php">a boring functional spec with an illusion of agreement.</a> Rough little drawings can done rapidly and ideas can be expressed fast enough to evolve them in a loose conversational manner.</li>
                                <li><strong>Be extremely multi-threaded.</strong> It’s better when a team can cycle through ideas for several projects simultaneously, rather than go in circles on a single topic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Be easily archived.</strong> Using paper instead of whiteboards makes it ideal for flipping back through past ideas, instead of being stuck on a single drawing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Be a fun exercise instead of a painful debate.</strong> That’s really the underlying goal, not some dry metric on productivity. You want your team to be feeling those intangible positives that come from a truly great meeting, the kind that improves on both product direction as well as morale.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a></h2>

                            <p>So that’s my take on an alternative to design sprints for stimulating collective thought. Whether it’s called a mini sprint, design studio, visual brainstorming or just plain sketching, I haven’t seen this exact format discussed much online. That’s a shame, since it’s a a hidden gem and a super unique part of my designer’s toolkit.</p>

                            <p>Mini sprints are one of my favorite methods for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions with solid design ideas and more importantly, enthusiasm about future projects from the team.</p>

                            <p>If you’ve actually made it this far, I can’t thank you enough for giving so much of your valuable attention in this age of info overload. Trust me, I’m tickled by the irony of writing over five thousand words on better ways to save time :)</p>
