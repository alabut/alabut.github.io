Design Sprints have spread far and wide from their initial roots at startups and have become a ubiquitous practice on a global scale. It's a good bet that any designer reading this probably already knows what they are.

It’s like the way all engineers are familiar with the basic principles of agile development, even if they don’t rigidly follow every step of the process. The ideas are just part of our common vocabulary now.

But in the years since it's popped up, it's worth taking a step back to ask: are design sprints right for everyone? Are there better design and collaboration techniques?

## 1. Disclaimer: All Advice Is Relative 

Just to state this up front: I’m not against design sprints, agile development or any other methodology for design, engineering or business.

Even waterfall has it's place. There's a reason it helped organize half a million government employees in the 60's for the space program!

> Waterfall sent men to the moon

And I'm also not against the idea of process in general. In fact, quite the opposite - I’m a process omnivore and devoured them all when I was figuring out my own approach in the first half of my career. I tried many different things, kept the bits that worked and never stayed wedded to any one single approach.

Over time, I formed my own flexible and idiosyncratic methods that play to my own unique strengths.

I'm sure it's part of my personality to prefer a flexible toolbox rather than a repeatable pipeline. I.e. focusing on results and quality over process and documentation. Which also explains my chosen industry - startups are judged by the market in real time, whereas agencies for example benefit from having a transparent process to attract clients. Same tools, different game.

But I don't think an eclectic approach is unique to my temperament or sector of technology - it's probably also a function of seniority. Everyone tends to get a broader view as they progress in their career and have more approaches to compare against.

Personality, work environment, seniority - those are some of the factors that explain why your mileage will vary on any advice, from me or anyone else. Everyone has different learning styles, preferred workplaces and experience levels, so you should consider the context of any advice.

> The supposed benefits of any technique depends on your own preferences and circumstances.

So like a business edition of the Rashomon effect, what I’m saying is that “good process” is relative and not everything is a universal truth. This is my own personal take on the role of design in the business world and consider this your warning that I'm an unreliable narrator in the story that follows :)

## 2. The Origin Story

### 2.1 History & Format

In case anyone is unfamiliar with the practice or needs a quick refresher, a design sprint "is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers," according to [the official website](https://www.gv.com/sprint/).

> Might not need this tweet but just in case: https://twitter.com/interacting/status/1177206940117676032

It was initially created by Jake Knapp and used internally within Google on various products before Jake became a partner at Google Ventures, where he then applied it to their portfolio of startups and brought in other design partners to evolve and refine the process.

Each day has a different focus and [set of exercises](https://www.gv.com/sprint/#how-to):

* **Monday -** map out the problem and pick an important place to focus.
* **Tuesday -** sketch competing solutions on paper.
* **Wednesday -** make difficult decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis
* **Thursday -** hammer out a high-fidelity prototype.
* **Friday -** test it with real live humans.

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*epqcNSs9BLwjvLfW8tkMrg.jpeg)

### 2.2 Inspired By Agile

Although designers have worked within a sprint format on engineering-centric teams for a long time, what brought the term "design sprints" to the tipping point of broad awareness is the particular format popularized by Google Ventures and [their subsequent book documenting the process.](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/)

Design sprints have a few similarities to the agile version for developers:

* Work is highly atomized and structured.
* Projects are timeboxed to less than a week.
* An emphasis on concrete outcomes and working prototypes, instead of research and strategy.
* Collaborative approach between various roles.
* Transparency into technical tasks and progress.

## 3. Reception

### 3.1 Upends UX Dogma

Design sprints have clear upsides and it’s easy to see why the practice has such widespread appeal. It’s simple to learn, emphasizes collaboration, and uses testable prototypes to shortcut engineering overhead, all within a specific timeframe.

> rave review: https://twitter.com/genesystechhub/status/1169992690311794688

Not only is it fun to shortcut engineering overhead and jump straight to getting user insights, it also goes against the grain of established UX techniques that often add unnecessary overhead without proven benefits.

From Jonathan Courtney's article *[User Research is Overrated](https://medium.com/p/user-research-is-overrated-6b0fe101d41)*:

> Up-front User Research is a form of Product Procrastination. It’s busy-work, it’s a way to avoid making hard decisions. It delays the need to make something tangible.

...and...

> It took a while, but eventually we started to notice a worrying pattern: We would do the pre-research for a specific product or service, do the interviews, create the personas, create the documentation then as soon as we got down designing and testing the actual product, we figured out that even though it was nice to “have the user in mind” when designing, **the useful data came from the first user tests, not the research.** 

User interviews, focus groups, personas, empathy maps, mindmapping, ethnographic field studies... it's all a bit much, especially if you're not in a large corporate environment trying to sell the results of your work across a wide-range of stakeholders. "UX" has quickly become synonymous with "enterprise" and although there might always be large companies with rigid hierarchies, the trend is definitely towards smaller and quicker teams that just get down to business.

You don't have to skip the research, you can use sprints in combination with traditional UX techniques if you get value out of them and have the bandwidth. The emphasis on jumping straight to possible solutions - or "solutioneering" - might not be for everyone either, depending on how well you know your users and the problems to be solved.

But for a lot of people, especially designers and engineers, that stuff isn't the work you signed up to do. You're not in some anthropology class about technology, you're an action-oriented type that just wants to make cool and useful stuff. 

> tweet about action: https://twitter.com/MiroHQ/status/1155899595710291968

Compared to the previous 20 years of UX dogma, it's just a much more natural approach to brainstorm up ideas, sketch out a few, and then test out some prototypes on prospective users.

### 3.2 Teaches Leadership Skills

On top of sprints being easy to learn and focused on action, I can also see how they can act as a communication bootcamp for introverts and new grads.

> Tweet about learning team management skills: https://twitter.com/ChynnaSevilleno/status/1181384676830670848

Teaching leadership skills is absolutely vital. It's critical for designers to lead teams proactively, rather than reactively create whatever’s dictated to them.

> Whether you like it or not, being a designer is a leadership role because design sets the standard for product quality and user delight for the entire organization.

And leadership means independent thought, not just collaboration - using your own critical thinking skills to work through problems and potential solutions, rather than just doing what the hippo says. (link to: highest paid person’s opinion) Otherwise you're just a cog in the groupthink machine.

> HIPPO definition - highest paid person's opinion

So hell yeah, I'm down with anything that shines the spotlight on a designer for a week and encourages the kind of leadership skills that set the tone for the entire team.

> Another thing they don’t teach you in design school is what you get paid for…
> 
> Mostly, designers get paid to negotiate the difficult terrain of individual egos, expectations, tastes, and aspirations of various individuals in an organization or corporation, against business needs, and constraints of the marketplace…
> 
> Getting a large, diverse group of people to agree on a single new methodology for all of their corporate communications means the designer has to be a strategist, psychiatrist, diplomat, showman, and even a Svengali. The complicated process is worth money. That’s what clients pay for.
> 
> Paula Scher Principal at Pentagram

That's a lot of positives so far. **Overall, design sprints sound like a fun game with clear rules and a way to demystify creative work by turning it into a repeatable process,** while also encouraging concrete user insights, communication and independent thought.

### 3.3 Rules Are Necessary For Learning

Also, another pretty big benefit is that designers earlier in the career thrive under a prescriptive approach, from what I’ve gleaned from conversations on Twitter and popular forums like Designers Guild.

> student tweet: https://twitter.com/DanLinna/status/1167416866702266368

The simple rules of a sprint are definitely more approachable compared to other schools of thought in the design world - e.g. the vague and hand wavy principles of design thinking, and the research-centric and documentation-oriented techniques of enterprise UX.

There's a very good reason that simple rules are so important: a well-documented process is fantastic for those in the initial skill acquisitions phases of their career. 

A more in-depth explanation is the [Dreyfuss model of skill acquisition](https://collegeinfogeek.com/dreyfus-model/), which outlines the typical developmental stages someone goes through when progressing from student to master.

![](https://richrtesting.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dreyfus-2.png?w=748)

If you're interested in reading more about smart techniques for sharpening your thinking skills, regardless of where you are in your career, then I highly recommend the book [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050). It's one of a handful of classics that I come back to every few years for a refresher and to gain insights into new chapters in my life.

On a personal note, I was no different early on - I loved rules too. Fervently.

When I was starting out, I so dogmatic about following Jakob Nielsen's advice that my best man gave a usability-themed speech at my wedding. I ate up anything I could about usability, HCI, UX and design. I saved up every penny of the education budget at my first job to attend the workshops by Adaptive Path, the pioneering design consultancy. Their all-star founders shaped the nascent UX field and gave clear guidelines for rookies like me.

The kind of [heuristic techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) you learn from rules are invaluable for getting up and running in a difficult and competitive field.

### 3.4 Big Companies Crave Process

In addition to being accessible to new designers and non-designers alike, a clearly defined and regimented format is a natural fit for larger organizations that prioritize steady dependable results over the fits and starts of smaller startups. You know the kind of places I'm talking about - the ones that use corporate buzzwords like "innovation" without a hint of irony.

> tweet about using design sprints on a lufthansa flight! https://twitter.com/Enrique77W/status/1170264353041526789

or...

> tweet from Deloitte on their visualization of agile: https://twitter.com/sharonodea/status/1158631585643728897

Given the hunger in the corporate world for the latest business trend, it's no wonder the initial blog posts and books for starry-eyed newbies have expanded into a small constellation of workshops, conferences and even certification courses for facilitators. Maybe design sprints will be just like countless business fads before it that went supernova and then experienced gravitational collapse down to a background radiation level of influence.

> Dilbert on business fads: https://dilbert.com/strip/2007-01-19

Or maybe it'll grow ever larger and calcify into the kind of thing taught in business schools. I'm sure there's still a handful of gasbags somewhere that brag about being scrum masters, right?

> "innovation" tweet about army and vanderbilt doing a design sprint: https://twitter.com/TheRakkasans/status/1141720047691423752

As someone that worked at a public university for the first few years of my career, I'm utterly unsurprised that someone in academia would refer to the army as "innovative" without a hint of irony. Those are the kind of situations where a week of meetings really is a quick sprint, compared to the status quo.

### 3.5 My Initial Reaction

Still, I remember being a bit surprised when design sprints first started to get popular. I remember thinking, *doesn’t everyone know this stuff already?*

I’m not saying good design is universal these days, just that the principles for tackling those challenges seem pretty well documented.

It’s not like design sprints are bringing awareness to new techniques like when the UX field was first starting up, so design sprints sounded to me like they were just an agile-flavored remix of typical best practices: group brainstorming, usability tests, quick prototypes, etc. Basic stuff taught in any school or bootcamp these days, and also very easy to pick up for self-taught types.

In fact, I should be exactly the target audience for this: a designer from a technical background that’s comfortable with agile techniques and early stage companies. **Doing the full-stack of design with fast engineers at startups is my jam.** So is doing user research on the fly and without making a big production out of it.

Being a designer at an early stage company is particularly challenging and takes a specific kind of attitude, whether learned or acquired. A sort of punk rock level of independence that doesn’t mind being a lone wolf outnumbered by engineers and business types.

> tweet about product design is punk: https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1034618587955298304

I’ll check out anything that’s down with the cause of making design faster and comes from the helter skelter world of startups.

So I looked past my initial reaction and dug into it a bit more. After all, it’s an admirable goal to help designers be more nimble and execution-oriented.

But without getting into the age-old debate on the drawbacks of agile, reading up on the rigid schedule and emphasis on collaboration over expertise rubbed me the wrong way and made me see why my spidey sense had gone off. It made me think of a paraphrased version of the old saying about regular expressions:

> Some designers struggle to keep up with developers and think “I know, I’ll make our design process more like agile development.”
> 
> Now you’ve got two problems.

Well more like a handful problems, when I get into specifics in the section on drawbacks.

### 3.6 Detractors

Ok, so if you're not already super experienced as a designer or technical enough to be familiar with potential drawbacks of agile development, design sprints still sound great. Actually they sound kind of fun - a whole week to collaborate with your colleagues in new ways and learn various thought-provoking design exercises. So who wouldn’t like that?

Well, I have some reservations. And I'm not alone.

> I am utterly and completely tired of anyone who claims to have a one size fits all design process to solve all problems. It’s lazy, misleading, and a sign of an inexperienced designer who can’t objectively choose the right process for the current problem.

> Ian Swinson  Senior design executive

I’m sure every process has its detractors and it’s not a fit for every situation, so that’s to be expected and perfectly normal. I thought at first that maybe my qualms were because of the type of teams that I'm used to - super scrappy early stage startups with absolutely no time to spare - but pinging others made me realize that it might be a wider problem and not just an individual preference or work situation.

And the critics aren't limited to just people that I know personally. When I read articles like Erika Hall's ["Design Sprints Are Snake Oil"](https://medium.com/mule-design/design-sprints-are-snake-oil-fd6f8e385a27) and Invision's ["When A Design Sprint Isn't The Answer"](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-sprint-wont-work/), that's when I decided to document my qualms in a more detailed way and explain my startup-centric view of the practice.

After all, if I'm not the only one seeing downsides to this trend and sprints won't work in every situation, then there's a need for people to learn about alternatives. So let's get into why a week-long sprint is a non-starter in many circumstances and then cleanse the palate with a few helpful alternatives.

## 4. Drawbacks

### 4.1 Selling Instead Of Doing

Various techniques will go in and out fashion over time, that's just a natural part of any industry. However, there's one universal constant about them all: there’s what a methodology says it’ll do on the packaging and *what its actual purpose is.*

> dilbert-on-agile.gif

For example, it’s a recurring joke that agile development isn't always very agile. Extremely regimented and formal versions of the process make a development team anything but quick and nimble.

Yet that’s for a good reason, since *agile is really about expectation management for stakeholders* and avoiding executive randomization of engineering pipelines, not making developers faster.

Similarly, design sprints probably won't produce the absolute best design work because it's not about making designers better. There's a larger meta goal instead: stakeholder buy-in. You can say it's about teamwork but whatever you call it, the exercise is meant to build respect for designers so that they have the time it takes do more informed work.

> Let’s get real - design sprints are about getting buy-in from stakeholders by teaching design basics.

Buy-in for common best practices is useful. It's a smart idea to teach overall principles of the discipline to stakeholders and engineers so that they'll understand the time and research it actually takes to cook up decent work. Hopefully they'll also see the true cost of rushed and reactive work that doesn't address underlying UX issues.

However, a week is a long time to take off just for subtle power dynamics. Even if your company isn't in constant survival mode, you should be able to establish solid design principles without completely pausing the product pipeline and asking everyone to learn arcane techniques.

I get that design is fun and everyone's got an opinion about it, but can you imagine doing this for every role in the company? Taking a week off to learn sales techniques, then another one for customer support triaging, then yet another for leadership, then a bootcamp for picking the next engineering stack...

Come on, let's get real. That sounds like a course about workplaces, not an actual workplace. **At some point, you have to trust that everyone will just do their damn jobs.**

All of this means you should temper your expectations about the actual design work that will come out at the other end of a design sprint. You probably won’t emerge from one of these things with a shiny new design that’ll save the business, for example.

Again, these are admirable goals but the week-long format is not a fit for a lot of teams, ones with pressing and business-critical needs, with stakeholders that trust the expertise of their hires, and with designers that already know when to use the right tools and in self-sufficient ways that don’t slow everyone down.

### 4.2 Startups Don't Have Time

And neither does anyone else, really.

It might be ironic to complain about design sprints taking too long when it claims to reduce months of dawdling to a single focused week, but even a entire week is too long to waste in my experience.

Time - and the lack of it - is the main reason I've become accustomed to using a variety of techniques on an ad hoc basis. The types of high-pressure environments I’m used to can’t take off even just a few days from their usual work of developing and shipping features. It’s impossible for most startups to press pause for that long, no matter how dire their design debt.

Startups aren't the only ones without time. A healthy sense of urgency is a major commonality between all productive teams and endless meetings is a pretty good sign of the opposite.

> lots of great Dilbert examples here: https://dilbert.com/search_results?terms=Meeting%20Time%20Wasted
> https://dilbert.com/strip/1997-02-25
> https://dilbert.com/strip/2001-12-15

Years ago, after I moved to SF but before I went to my first startup, I worked at a mid-sized company that regularly hosted large meetings with dozens of people. I used to amuse myself by estimating how much money we were wasting and it was never less than thousands of dollars. You can try it yourself with [an online calculator for meeting costs.](https://www.calculators.org/business/meeting-costs.php)

That doesn't mean small or fast teams never need meetings or a solid product direction. Actually, they need design guidance the most, because otherwise you accidentally cook up an explosive cocktail; a frenetic pace of feature development doesn't combine well with an early company poking around in the dark for product/market fit. Startups inevitably run into avoidable pot holes because of their overwhelming emphasis on maintaining momentum, even while in an exploratory mode to define their main purpose.

So how do you reconcile the massive design needs with the utter lack of time?

The answer is not to cram a week’s worth of design activities into less time, it’s simply to use the right tools at the right time, as you go along. 

Designing humane products and apps while having effective collaboration is not a one time fix - it's part of the work culture for solid design-driven teams.

> Erika Hall's tweet comparing design sprints to a crash diet: https://twitter.com/mulegirl/status/778647186166865922

And especially when it comes to team exercises, you should be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and make sure to space it out as much as possible, otherwise you're wasting not just your time but everyone else's as well. 

Just to jump ahead and preview an alternative that I'll describe in a later section below, you can use [a 90 minute exercise like structured sketching](#sketching) to coax out the collective knowledge of a team without grinding an entire work week to a halt. 

Most of the techniques in a design sprint are ones that a self-sufficient designer should be able to carry out in parallel, whether solo or by pairing up with devs and PMs, so why waste everybody’s time by exposing them to esoteric techniques?

### 4.3 Execution Trumps Strategy 

The underlying reason why startups don’t have time is actually pretty rational and applies to most other company types too: **staying busy is a survival mechanism.** People try to stay busy shipping meaningful work, otherwise they risk stagnation at best and existential threats at worst.

One of the dirty secrets of business is that work is 90 percent execution. Success is less about inspiration or random strategizing than it is just plain getting shit done, day after day. Even at startups. Especially at startups, actually.

It doesn’t matter whether we’re talking about companies that are large or small, remote or co-located, ones with green logos or blue… The hard truth is that all truly effective teams are stocked full of high performing “armies of one” that use their energy to come up with and implement solutions, not to generate stunningly original ideas for work.

> EVERYONE HAS IDEAS BUT REAL ARTISTS SHIP.

It makes sense, right? You can’t afford to have a company filled only with “visionary” types, daydreamers making academic arguments all day. You need people that can soldier on and learn by doing.

Yes, you need both modes of work - productivity and reflection - but that doesn’t mean equal amounts of time or a rigid schedule for each. Every person and team have to find their own rhythm and balance. Avoiding too much action without thought or thought without action is about team chemistry, personal challenges, and the interplay between them.

Plus anyway, it’s not like taking a break from the rigors of the usual execution-oriented work to host a strategy session is guaranteed to stimulate calm and reflective thought, peppered with smart conversation and interesting doodles that culminate in brilliant insights. Ha! If only.

In the real world, strategy sessions are often the opposite of productivity. Sharpie showdowns at the whiteboard, going in circles with endless debates, all while losing momentum on shipping meaningful work. Meeting hell. Wasted time. Vacillating ad nauseam.

> Good designers abhor vacillation and make teams faster, not drag them down.

Just even imagining taking an entire week off of shipping features gives me the heebie-jeebies. And don't get me started on spending a day voting on features with post-its like grade schoolers assigning gold stars!

With all of my harping on **speed, independence and most of all, high quality end results,** I guess you could say that these are my version of [Dieter Rams' principles of good design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#"Good_design"_principles), especially at startups.

A good designer knows how to:
* Trawl through support requests to understand customer needs.
* Interview stakeholders to distill business goals.
* Do competitive analysis.
* Make their own prototypes to test solutions.
* Prioritize feature work.
* **And countless other things, without having to stop for guidance at every step.**

And when it comes to group collaboration techniques, they keep their powder dry and only gather the entire team when absolutely necessary and for the minimum time possible, to respect their colleagues' time and energy.

### 4.4 Design Exercises Look Funny

While we're at it, let’s also be real about how design exercises come across to most people.

Design exercises intended for collaboration look exactly like pointless vacillation to engineers or business types. Or hell, just even everyday normal civilians.

Stickies, whiteboard doodles, giant markers, weirdly scripted interactions that treat valuable customers like lab mice… they’re all insanely valuable tools that I love using. Hell, I’ve been running usability tests for two decades. The first book I bought with my first paycheck at my first gig out of college was Designing Web Usability, the Jakob Nielsen classic.

But I live in the real world and recognize that these techniques are completely unfamiliar and strangely childish for most non-designers, so they have to be used as needed on a project and definitely not all at once as a substitute for critical thought. That’s my usual assumption: everyone else is just too damn busy with spinning their own plates to stop and do my job for me.

> Regular people are busy doing their jobs and want designers to just get on with doing theirs too, not to push the esoteric details of their internal methods on to everyone else.

It’s an absolute non-starter to ask most teams to pause their work for a week to play with kindergarten-style toys just so you can figure out what the hell to work on and how to test its efficacy. It will get you laughed out of the room!

You might as well turn down the lights, put on some crappy world music and scroll through random nature scenes while asking whether the design should feel like a leopard or a butterfly.

> video from Silicon Valley

### 4.5 You Can’t Crowdsource Expertise 

Playing with crayons and crowdsourcing product decisions by voting with post-its isn’t the best way to show design expertise anyway.

That's not the way to show expertise and authority. You'll get respect if you respect other people’s challenges — their business needs, engineering constraints, customer support backlog, and a thousand other things — all without bringing the whole team to a stop.

Gaining respect comes from understanding everyone else’s needs, on the fly and under massive time pressures.

And most of all, respect comes from doing great work. You might not always get credit for nailing a design but guess who gets the blame if you throw every single idea into a blender and call it a group decision? Not the team or process. They’ll blame you, the designer. And rightly so - you’re supposed to be the arbiter of team input that distills down disparate needs into distinctly understandable visuals, not a hoarder that throws every idea into a junk drawer.

Good designs are hard decisions made visual - don’t shirk the responsibility under the guise of collaboration. Otherwise you’re no better than a PM or technical lead desperately cobbling together wireframes out of random design kits.

> "Bad design gets out in the world not because the people working on it lack skills, but often because the decision-making process is broken. Fixing that is a team effort that has to go bottom up, top down, and all the way across." [Erika Hall on Medium](https://medium.com/mule-design/why-i-decided-to-revise-just-enough-research-9aadebd03534)

 **I don't know what it is about designers but so many are reactive "the client is always right" types and find it challenging to lead people.**

I can think of a few possible reasons that many designers struggle to lead teams:
* Communication skills and independent thought are essential soft skills that are often overlooked in a typical curriculum.
* Leadership can be more challenging to develop for some of the more introverted personality types that are attracted to aesthetic and creative expression.
* Designers - UX designers in particular - are defined in some quarters as more of a facilitator than a producer. They're like an artsy visual version of a project coordinator that emphasizes consensus and research, rather than a strong product manager type that sets the vision and drives action.

It's a critical skill for designers to think for themselves amidst the pressure of being vastly outnumbered by other roles. The stakes are high. It’s about more than just doing good individual work, it’s setting the bar for expected product quality for everyone and avoiding the lowest common denominator outcomes.

Don’t just take my word for it, look at the science — there are research studies backing this up. Groupthink is the most common team dynamic and the results are inferior to solitary thought by individuals.

So collaboration is great and all but that’s not the only thing you’re hired to do, to make sure everyone gets along no matter what. You’re there to make great products. **You need to be strong, speak up and most of all, lead.**

## 5. Alternatives 

### 5.1 Be Fast & Flexible

I sprinkled some alternatives throughout the critiques and it's worth recapping them all in one list. Here's my overall principles of how to survive at startups and other demanding environments, all while doing good work and showing design leadership:

* Use an “unprocess”. Pick the right tools at the right time and in a self-sufficient manner, rather than a regimented formal schedule. Think toolbox, not pipeline.
* Keep up team momentum. Work 1-on-1 with various roles and bring the entire team together only in short bursts.
* Understand everyone else’s needs rather than pushing design methods on other people to understand your goals. I.e. practice good user research skills within your own company.
* Avoid groupthink. Don’t shirk hard decisions for the sake of consensus, or you’ll only agree on the lowest common denominator and make Frankenstein designs.

Think of this as my playbook for the kind of things designers ask about all the time: how to survive as a sole designer amongst engineers and earn the right to be at the decision-making table with business stakeholders.

### 5.2 Limit Team Meetings In Length & Frequency

For team exercises in particular, I’ve found that the best format to bring everyone together is a long afternoon meeting, regardless of the particular topic or design exercise. It's just long enough to get their best thinking, yet short enough to fit into an otherwise busy week.

> Anything longer than the length of a movie is a corporate group therapy session disguised as real work.

There's probably a biological reason why movies are all 90-120 minutes. It's about how long you can expect a group of people to pay attention to a single topic before they have to get up to eat, use the restroom, or just get on with their day.

So it turns out to be the goldilocks amount for team meetings as well - not too short to rush through things, not too long to melt brains into uselessness.

E.g. for brainstorming, that’s just enough time to clear the air and vent any pent-up ideas before discussing more experimental solutions. For usability tests, it’s enough time to watch a session and discuss the lessons learned afterwards. So on and so forth.

And just like you wouldn't try to squeeze in a movie every day at work, long team meetings shouldn't be the norm or a standing meeting of any kind. That's when organizational calcification starts to set it. Long meetings are just a good tool to have in your back pocket for when collaboration-centric topics have backed up and need airing out.

### 5.3 Practice Structured Sketching

Sometimes you really do need an all-hands meeting to crack a problem and tap into the collective wisdom of the team, yet you don't want to fall into the usual pitfalls of brainstorming at a whiteboard: one large canvas for extroverts to dominate a conversation and solidify the groupthink in the name of consensus.

**When it comes to effective brainstorming, you want to strike a balance between individual thought** - stimulating reflective thinking from every team member - **and collective decisions** - synthesizing the best ideas into concrete product directions. All the other design exercises can be done individually by a designer, things like the creation of testable prototypes and gathering user insights.

To strike that balance, I like using a team exercise called a design studio. Originally a workshop over 1 to 2 days, I modified the format and cut it down to 90 minutes or less to get the same benefits. I wrote an article on the Zapier blog explaining the format and [documenting the one we did at an off-site](https://zapier.com/blog/run-a-design-studio/), but the gist of it is very simple:

* Split a room full of people into teams of 3-4 and give them all sharpies and paper.
* Pick a vexing problem or potential new feature currently on everyone's minds, assigning one to each team.
* Do timed rounds of drawing ideas, first individually and then as a group.

There's a bit more detail - e.g. each round has a specific format - so [check out the longer article](https://zapier.com/blog/run-a-design-studio/) for more info.

## 6. Conclusion 

That pretty much covers my take on design sprints. I can see a lot of positives but for myself personally, I guess I'm skeptical of sticking to any one approach and taking off an entire week for a rigid format that makes an exciting workplace feel like I'm stuck in a remedial school.

I’m not saying I have all the answers, just that people should try something different if they’ve had similar reservations.

If you don’t and your team is down to try a design sprints, then that’s great! Don’t let me stop you. Have fun practicing your craft and learning new skills.

One thing I'd keep in mind before going into one of these: don’t worry about whether the deliverables are world changing or will fix all of your business needs in 5 days. Just think of it more as a team building exercise that indoctrinates the value of design and familiarizes everyone with the tools of the trade.

Teamwork is the ultimate end result of a design sprint because the team will still be there while various business techniques come and go, so use whatever means necessary to wear all the different hats that designers are expected to be comfortable with.

On the other hand, if you’re a designer experiencing any of the problems I described about design sprints — if you find yourself chafing under rigid formats like I did with agile when I was starting out, if you like fast teams but all you want is better design input and don’t want the overhead of a dozen different exercises over the course of a week — you should probably experiment with other methods, techniques that are quicker and more flexible.

Try to mix things up a bit occasionally with things like structured sketching. Block out an afternoon once in a while (let’s say quarterly or so, whenever you feel like there’s pent up demand for brainstorming) and give the exercise a whirl instead to see how it works for you.

And most of all, just try to keep your head on straight. This job is hard but rewarding.

## 7. Epilogue 

If you’ve actually made it this far, I can’t thank you enough for giving so much of your valuable attention, especially in this age of info overload and Twitter-sized witticisms. Trust me, I’m tickled by the irony of writing thousands of words on better ways to save time :)

### 3.4 Agencies Use It For Client Discovery & Sales

There's a symbiotic parallel in the agency world, since they often sell into larger companies and act as the source and supplier of their enthusiasm for new business trends. Getting a large client excited about novel ways of working together is probably the hardest 90% of the job.

> Paula Scher quote

(Something something about agencies and freelancers...? Get feedback from Pauly Ting?) SOMETHING ABOUT HOW RULES ARE ALSO USEFUL FOR AGENCIES OR FREELANCERS BECAUSE CLIENTS LIKE A CLEAR PROCESS FOR HOW A PROJECT WILL GO. IT HELPS TO SET EXPECTATIONS AND ALSO SET A RHYTHM FOR A SHORT TERM WORKFLOW.

So that's why agencies sell the process.

HOLY SHIT, VOTING FOR PRODUCT FEATURES IS HILARIOUS. IF I HAD TO PUT ASIDE THE TIME COMMITMENT AND PICK ONE SPECIFIC EXERCISE TO CRUCIFY, IT'S THE HORSESHIT AROUND POST-ITS AND GOLD STARS.

ALTHOUGH THE USER JOURNEY AND OTHER SHIT IS FUNNY TOO.

THIS COULD BE THE SPOT TO ATTACK THE GOOGLEY HERD-OF-CATS APPROACH TO PRODUCT MANAGEMENT AND LINK TO THE TAKEDOWN OF THEIR CULTURE IN WIRED, DARING FIREBALL, ETC. Let's drink every time they release a chat bot!

...OR COULD THAT BE JUST A TAD TOO VITRIOLIC?

And one thing leading doesn't mean is asking endless questions about the nuances of execution that they should already know or can figure out themselves. Whenever I see someone waffle out loud on the minutiae of every little decision, I always think of that Seinfeld clip about the carpenter that can't make up his mind anything and pesters Jerry all day.

> video from Seinfeld

The lack of design leadership can also be due to the workplace rather than the designer. I’ve seen the insane amount of churn at companies that don’t let designers lead and it’s usually the junior folk that suffer, the ones that need guidance the most.

Thankfully I’ve dodged those bullets for the most part - I can usually sense the turnover from a distance the way an experienced programmer can smell code rot - but it's still really hard to spot and I’ve seen way too many good creative people get burnt while the company cycles through fresh meat.

### 5.3

Group insights and consensus is exactly what the structured sketching exercise generates with nothing more than markers, paper, and a stopwatch. It’s a more efficient way to get what I consider to be the core benefit of a much longer design sprint.

Pick your battles with when to add structure...?

So when it comes to keeping up momentum while gathering team feedback in an actually productive way, sometimes you really do need an all-hands meeting to get the creative juices flowing across various areas of expertise. A designer can't actually do it all alone. 

That’s why I’ve sought out a better approach for collecting design input, something that’s better than a typical brainstorming session with whiteboards and fits with my approach to teamwork on fast teams that I outlined above.

NOTE: [insert a link to Will Evans? something about how I first heard about it from him and it’s worked pretty great in all the years since]

So that’s my take on an alternative to design sprints for stimulating collective thought. Whether it’s called a mini sprint, design studio, visual brainstorming or just plain sketching, I haven’t seen this exact format discussed much online. That’s a shame, since it’s a a hidden gem and a super unique part of my designer’s toolkit.

Mini sprints are one of my favorite methods for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions with solid design ideas and more importantly, enthusiasm about future projects from the team.

NOTE: Add one last parting shot at design sprints to wrap this sucker up…




I think having an eclectic appetite and flexible work style is important in acquiring valuable skills. It's definitely worked out pretty well for me in my career. I haven’t hit any home runs in my career but I'm proud of all the base hits: designing useful things that get acquired, cofounding companies, and going through the world’s most prestigious startup incubator. I like to think that surviving and even thriving in the ever-changing world of tech means I know what I’m doing while also staying hungry for new methods.
