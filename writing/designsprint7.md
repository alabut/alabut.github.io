Design Sprints have spread far and wide from their initial roots at startups and have become a ubiquitous practice on a global scale. It's a good bet that any designer reading this probably already knows what they are.

It’s like the way all engineers are familiar with the basic principles of agile development, even if they don’t rigidly follow every step of the process. The ideas are just part of our common vocabulary now.

But in the years since it's popped up, it's worth taking a step back to ask: are design sprints right for everyone? Are there better design and collaboration techniques?

## 1. Disclaimer: All Advice Is Relative 

Just to state this up front: I’m not against design sprints, agile development or any other methodology for design, engineering or business.

Even waterfall has it's place. There's a reason it helped organize half a million government employees in the 60's for the space program!

> Waterfall sent men to the moon

And I'm also not against the idea of process in general. In fact, quite the opposite - I’m a process omnivore and devoured them all when I was figuring out my own approach in the first half of my career. I tried many different things, kept the bits that worked and never stayed wedded to any one single approach.

Over time, I formed my own flexible and idiosyncratic methods that play to my own unique strengths.

I'm sure it's part of my personality to prefer a flexible toolbox rather than a repeatable pipeline. I.e. focusing on results and quality over process and documentation. Which also explains my chosen industry - startups are judged by the market in real time, whereas agencies for example benefit from having a transparent process to attract clients. Same tools, different game.

But I don't think an eclectic approach is unique to my temperament or sector of technology - it's probably also a function of seniority. Everyone tends to get a broader view as they progress in their career and have more approaches to compare against.

Personality, work environment, seniority - those are some of the factors that explain why your mileage will vary on any advice, from me or anyone else. Everyone has different learning styles, prefered workplaces and experience levels, so you should consider the context of any advice.

> The supposed benefits of any technique depends on your own preferences and circumstances.

So like a business edition of the Rashomon effect, what I’m saying is that “good process” is relative and not everything is a universal truth. This is my own personal take on the role of design in the business world and consider this your warning that I'm an unreliable narrator in the story that follows :)

## 2. The Origin Story

### 2.1 Format

BRIEF DESCRIPTION GOES HERE & GRAPHIC ABOUT 5 DAY SCHEDULE

### 2.2 Inspired By Agile

Designers have been working within a sprint format on engineering-centric teams for a long time, but what brought the term "design sprints" to the tipping point of broad awareness is the particular format popularized by Google Ventures and their book documenting the process.

Design sprints have a few similarities to the agile version for developers:

* Work is highly atomized and structured.
* Projects are timeboxed to less than a week.
* An emphasis on concrete outcomes and working prototypes.
* Collaborative approach between various roles.
* Transparency into technical tasks and progress.

SOMETHING SOMETHING ABOUT HOW I CAN SEE THAT BEING AGILE-LIKE IS PROBABLY ENGINEERING-FRIENDLY, GIVEN THE STRUCTURED AND STRICTLY TIMEBOXED NATURE OF THE FORMAT, WHICH MEANS IT SHOULD ALSO BE PALATABLE/COMPREHENSIBLE/APPROACHABLE TO PMS AND STAKEHOLDERS USED TO WORKING WITH AGILE TEAMS.

OR TALK ABOUT STARTUPS AND THE GV ORIGIN IN TALKING TO STARTUPS?

OR SOME SUCH SHIT. THIS SECTION IS JUST A TAD TOO SHORT.

## 3. Reception

### 3.1 Loved By Many

Design sprints have clear upsides and it’s easy to see why the practice has such widespread appeal. It’s simple to learn, emphasizes collaboration, and uses testable prototypes to shortcut engineering overhead, all within a specific timeframe.

INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT USER RESEARCH BEING BULLSHIT AND HOW SPRINTS FOCUS ON ROUGH SKETCHES AND TESTABLE PROTOTYPES, WHICH IS GREAT. ALSO SAY "DESIGN THINKING" IS DOODLING NONSENSE.

I can also see how design sprints can act as a communication bootcamp for introverts and new grads.

Communication skills and independent thought are essential soft skills that are often overlooked in a typical curriculum and can be more challenging to develop for some personality types. It's critical for designers to lead teams proactively, rather than reactively create whatever’s dictated to them. Design leadership means independently thinking through problems and potential solutions, rather than just doing what the hippo says. (link to: highest paid person’s opinion) Otherwise you're just a cog in the groupthink machine.

Overall, design sprints sound like a fun game with clear rules, a way to demystify creative work by turning it into a repeatable process. It's definitely more approachable than the vague and hand wavy principles of “design thinking".

### 3.2 Rules Are Great For Learning

Designers earlier in the career seem to particularly benefit from a prescriptive approach, from what I’ve gleaned from conversations on Twitter and popular forums like Designers Guild.

A well-documented process is fantastic for those early in the skill acquisition phase of their career. When I was starting out, I was dogmatic about following Jakob Nielsen's advice, to the point that my best man at my wedding gave a usability-themed speech! I saved up every penny of the education budget at my first job to attend the workshops by Adaptive Path, the pioneering agency. Their all-star founders shaped the nascent UX field and gave clear guidelines for rookies like me. 

In addition to being accessible to new designers and non-designers alike, a clearly defined and regimented format is a natural fit for larger organizations that prioritize steady dependable results over the fits and starts of smaller startups. You know the kind of places I'm talking about - the ones that use corporate buzzwords like "innovation" without a hint of irony.

Given the hunger in the corporate world for the latest trendy process, it's no wonder the initial blog posts and books for starry-eyed newbies have expanded into a small constellation of workshops, conferences and even certification courses for facilitators of design sprints, just like countless business fads before it that went supernova and then experienced graviational collapse down to a background radiation level of influence. I'm sure there's still a handful of gasbags somewhere that brag about being scrum masters, right?

(Something something about agencies and freelancers...? Get feedback from Pauly Ting?) SOMETHING ABOUT HOW RULES ARE ALSO USEFUL FOR AGENCIES OR FREELANCERS BECAUSE CLIENTS LIKE A CLEAR PROCESS FOR HOW A PROJECT WILL GO. IT HELPS TO SET EXPECTATIONS AND ALSO SET A RHYTHM FOR A SHORT TERM WORKFLOW.

### 3.3 My Initial Reaction

Still, I remember being a bit surprised when design sprints first started to get popular. I remember thinking, *doesn’t everyone know this stuff already?*

I’m not saying good design is universal these days, just that the principles for tackling those challenges seem pretty well documented.

It’s not like design sprints are bringing awareness to new techniques like when the UX field was first starting up, so design sprints sounded to me like they were just an agile-flavored remix of typical best practices: group brainstorming, usability tests, quick prototypes, etc. Basic stuff taught in any school or bootcamp these days, and also very easy to pick up for self-taught types.

In fact, I should be exactly the target audience for this: a designer from a technical background that’s comfortable with agile techniques and early stage companies. Doing the full-stack of design with fast engineers at startups is my jam. So is doing user research on the fly and without making a big production out of it.

Being a designer at an early stage company is particularly challenging and takes a specific kind of attitude, whether learned or acquired. A sort of punk rock level of independence that doesn’t mind being a lone wolf outnumbered by engineers and business types.

INSERT TWEET ABOUT PRODUCT DESIGN = PUNK AND UX DESIGN = JAZZ.

I’ll check out anything that’s down with the cause of making design faster and comes from the helter skelter world of startups.

So I looked past my initial reaction and dug into it a bit more. After all, it’s an admirable goal to help designers be more nimble and execution-oriented.

But without getting into the age-old debate on the drawbacks of agile, reading up on the rigid schedule and emphasis on collaboration over expertise rubbed me the wrong way and made me see why my spidey sense had gone off. It made me think of a paraphrased version of the old saying about regular expressions:

> Some designers struggle to keep up with developers and think “I know, I’ll make our design process more like agile development.”
> 
> Now you’ve got two problems.

Well more like a handful problems, as I’ll describe later on in the section on workflow obstacles.

### 3.4 Detractors

Ok, so if you're not already super experienced as a designer or technical enough to be familiar with potential drawbacks of agile development, design sprints still sound great. Actually they sound kind of fun - a whole week to collaborate with your colleagues in new ways and learn various thought-provoking design exercises. So who wouldn’t like that?

Well, I’m not alone in having reservations.

> I am utterly and completely tired of anyone who claims to have a one size fits all design process to solve all problems. It’s lazy, misleading, and a sign of an inexperienced designer who can’t objectively choose the right process for the current problem.

> Ian Swinson  Senior design executive

I’m sure every process has its detractors and it’s not a fit for every situation, so that’s to be expected and perfectly normal. I thought at first that maybe my qualms were because of the type of teams that I'm used to - super scrappy early stage startups with absolutely no time to spare - but pinging others made me realize that it might be a wider problem and not just an individal preference or work situation.

INSERT LINK TO ERICA HALL'S MEDIUM ARTICLE

When I found out that I’m not the only one with reservations, that's when I realized that I needed to sit down and document my misgivings in a more detailed way.

After all, if I'm not alone in seeing the drawbacks, then maybe there's other people with a similar reaction that are open to alternatives. So let's get into what I think are the logistical drawbacks of why a week-long sprint is a non-starter in many situations, before we then cleanse the palate with helpful alternatives.

## 4. Drawbacks

### 4.1 Selling Instead Of Doing

Various techniques will go in and out fashion over time, that's just a natural part of any industry. However, there's one universal constant about them all: there’s what a methodology says it’ll do on the packaging and *what its actual purpose is.*

For example, it’s a recurring joke that agile development isn't always very agile. Extremely regimented and formal versions of the process make a development team anything but quick and nimble.

Yet that’s for a good reason, since *agile is really about expectation management for stakeholders* and avoiding executive randomization of engineering pipelines, not making developers faster.

Simlarly, design sprints probably won't produce the absolute best design work because it's not about making designers better. There's a larger meta goal instead: stakeholder buy-in. You can say it's about teamwork but whatever you call it, the exercise is meant to build respect for designers so that they have the time it takes do more informed work.

> Let’s get real - design sprints are about getting buy-in from stakeholders by teaching design basics.

Buy-in for common best practices is useful. It's a smart idea to teach overall principles of the discipline to stakeholders and engineers so that they'll understand the time and research it actually takes to cook up decent work. Hopefully they'll also see the true cost of rushed and reactive work that doesn't address underlying UX issues.

However, a week is a long time to take off just for subtle power dynamics. Even if your company isn't in constant survival mode, you should be able to establish solid design principles without completely pausing the product pipeline and asking everyone to learn arcane techniques.

I get that design is fun and everyone's got an opinion about it, but can you imagine doing this for every role in the company? Taking a week off to learn sales techniques, then another one for customer support triaging, then yet another for leadership, then a bootcamp for picking the next engineering stack...

Come on, let's get real. That sounds like a course about workplaces, not an actual workplace. At some point, you have to trust that everyone will just do their damn jobs.

All of this means you should temper your expectations about the actual design work that will come out at the other end of a design sprint. You probably won’t emerge from one of these things with a shiny new design that’ll save the business, for example.

Again, these are admirable goals but the week-long format is not a fit for a lot of teams, ones with pressing and business-critical needs, with stakeholders that trust the expertise of their hires, and with designers that already know when to use the right tools and in self-sufficient ways that don’t slow everyone down.

### 4.2 Startups Don't Have Time;Design Under Fire; All Business Is A Sprint; something something

The main reason I use a variety of techniques on an ad hoc basis is because the types of high-pressure environments I’ve worked in can’t take off a week (or even just a few days!) from their usual work. It’s impossible for most teams to press pause for that long, no matter how dire their design debt.

Startups just don't have a lot of time. That's a major thing all of the productive teams have in common.

Yet at the same time, the kind of early stage startups I’m most familiar with are exactly the teams that are most in need of solid product direction. The frenetic pace of feature development combines with the exploratory nature of a company’s early days in an explosive way. Startups inevitably run into avoidable pot holes and even potentially fatal cul de sacs because of their overwhelming emphasis on momentum.

So how do you reconcile the massive design needs with the utter lack of time?

The answer is not to cram a week’s worth of design activities into less time, it’s simply to use the right tools at the right time, as you go along. 

Designing humane products and apps while having effective collaboration is a mindset and active part of the work culture, not a one time fix.

And when it comes to team exercises, be highly selective about only the few key tasks that yield the most benefit and design insights, since a long afternoon meeting is all your team can realistically handle for any one technique, whether that’s user testing, brainstorming with sketches, or what have you.

Especially when it comes to exercises that are meant to coax out the collective knowledge of a team, all you really want is to stimulate the best ideas from every team member and synthesize them into concrete product directions. All the other techniques in a design sprint are ones that a self-sufficient designer should be able to carry out in parallel, whether solo or by pairing up with devs and PMs, so why waste everybody’s time with esoteric techniques?

***THIS PARA NEEDS REWORKING*** Group insights and consensus is exactly what the mini sprint format generates with nothing more than markers, paper, and a stopwatch. It’s a more efficient way to get what I consider to be the core benefit of a much longer design sprint.

NOTE: Move the paragraphs above into the section introing my technique?

### 4.3 Execution Trumps Strategy 

The underlying reason why startups don’t have time is actually pretty rational and applies to most other company types too: staying busy is a survival mechanism. People try to stay busy shipping meaningful work, otherwise they risk stagnation at best and existential threats at worst.

One of the dirty secrets of business is that work is 90 percent execution. Success is less about inspiration or random strategizing than it is just plain getting shit done, day after day. Even at startups. Especially at startups, actually.

It doesn’t matter whether we’re talking about companies that are large or small, remote or co-located, have green logos or blue… The hard truth is that all truly effective teams are stocked full of high performing “armies of one” that are mostly busy coming up with and implementing creative solutions, rather than using creativity to generate stunningly original ideas for work.

It makes sense, right? You can’t afford to have a company filled only with “visionary” types, daydreamers making academic arguments all day. You need people that can soldier on and learn by doing.
___

EVERYONE HAS IDEAS BUT REAL ARTISTS SHIP.
___

You need both modes of work - productivity and reflection - but that doesn’t mean equal amounts of time or a rigid schedule for each. Everyone has find their own rhythm for avoiding too much action without thought or thought without action. 

It’s not like taking a break from normal work for a strategy session is guaranteed to stimulate calm and reflective thought, peppered with smart writing and interesting doodles that culminate in brilliant insights. Ha! If only.

In the real world, strategy sessions are often the opposite of productivity. Sharpie showdowns at the whiteboard, going in circles with endless debates, all while losing momentum on shipping meaningful work. Meeting hell. Vascillating ad nauseam.

Good designers abhor vascillation. They keep up momentum and maybe even make teams faster, not drag them down.

NOTE: ⬆ that's a good candidate for larger graphic treatment.

I guess you could say that an emphasis on speed, independence and most of all, a high quality end product is my version of Dieter Rams' rules for good design. So in my experience, a good designer knows how to make their own prototypes, trawl through support requests to understand customer needs, do competitive analysis, prioritize feature work, and countless other things without having to stop for guidance at every step. 

And when it comes to group collaboration techniques, they keep their powder dry and only gather the entire team when absolutely necessary and for the minimum time possible, to respect their colleagues' time and energy.

### 4.4 Design Exercises Look Funny

While we're at it, let’s also be real about how design exercises come across to most people.

Design exercises intended for collaboration look exactly like pointless vacillation to engineers or business types. Or hell, just even everyday normal civilians.

Stickies, whiteboard doodles, giant markers, weirdly scripted interactions that treat valuable customers like lab mice… they’re all insanely valuable tools that I love using. Hell, I’ve been running usability tests for two decades. The first book I bought with my first paycheck at my first gig out of college was Designing Web Usability, the Jakob Nielsen classic.

But I live in the real world and recognize that these techniques are completely unfamiliar and stangely childish for most non-designers, so they have to be used as needed on a project and definitely not all at once as a substitute for critical thought. That’s my usual assumption: everyone else is just too damn busy with spinning their own plates to stop and do my job for me.

Regular people are busy doing their jobs and want designers to just get on with doing theirs too, not to push the esoteric details of their internal methods on to everyone else.

It’s an absolute non-starter to ask most teams to pause their work for a week to play with kindergarten-style toys just so you can figure out what the hell to work on and how to test its efficacy. It will get you laughed out of the room!

You might as well turn down the lights, put on some crappy world music and scroll through random nature scenes while asking whether the design should feel like a leopard or a butterfly.

### 4.5 You Can’t Crowdsource Expertise 

HOLY SHIT, VOTING FOR PRODUCT FEATURES IS HILARIOUS. IF I HAD TO PUT ASIDE THE TIME COMMITMENT AND PICK ONE SPECIFIC EXERCISE TO CRUCIFY, IT'S THE HORSESHIT AROUND POST-ITS AND GOLD STARS.

ALTHOUGH THE USER JOURNEY AND OTHER SHIT IS FUNNY TOO.

Playing with crayons and crowdsourcing product decisions by voting with post-its isn’t the best way to show design expertise anyway.

THIS COULD BE THE SPOT TO ATTACK THE GOOGLEY HERD-OF-CATS APPROACH TO PRODUCT MANAGEMENT AND LINK TO THE TAKEDOWN OF THEIR CULTURE IN WIRED, DARING FIREBALL, ETC. Let's drink every time they release a chat bot!

...OR COULD THAT BE JUST A TAD TOO VITRIOLIC? 

That's not the way to show expertise and authority. You'll get respect if you respect other people’s challenges — their business needs, engineering constraints, customer support backlog, and a thousand other things — all without bringing the whole team to a stop.

Gaining respect comes from understanding everyone else’s needs, on the fly and under massive time pressures.

And most of all, respect comes from doing great work. You might not always get credit for nailing a design but guess who gets the blame if you throw every single idea into a blender and call it a group decision? Not the team or process. They’ll blame you, the designer. And rightly so - you’re supposed to be the arbiter of team input that distills down disparate needs into distinctly understandable visuals, not a hoarder that throws every idea into a junk drawer.

Good designs are hard decisions made visual - don’t shirk the responsibility under the guise of collaboration. Otherwise you’re no better than a PM or technical lead desperately cobbling together wireframes out of random design kits.

It's a critical skill for designers to think for themselves amidst the pressure of being vastly outnumbered by other roles. The stakes are high. It’s about more than just doing good individual work, it’s setting the bar for expected product quality for everyone and avoiding the lowest common denominator outcomes.

Don’t just take my word for it, look at the science — there are research studies backing this up. Groupthink is the most common team dynamic and the results are inferior to solitary thought by individuals.

So collaboration is great and all but that’s not the only thing you’re hired to do, to make sure everyone gets along no matter what. You’re there to make great products. You need to be strong, speak up and most of all, lead.

And one thing leading doesn't mean is asking endless questions about the nuances of execution that they should already know or can figure out themselves. Whenever I see someone waffle out loud on the minutae of every little decision, I always think of that Seinfeld clip about the carpenter that can't make up his mind anything and pesters Jerry all day.

> video from Seinfeld

The lack of design leadership can also be due to the workplace rather than the designer. I’ve seen the insane amount of churn at companies that don’t let designers lead and it’s usually the junior folk that suffer, the ones that need guidance the most.

Thankfully I’ve dodged those bullets for the most part - I can usually sense the turnover from a distance the way an experienced programmer can smell code rot - but it's still really hard to spot and I’ve seen way too many good creative people get burnt while the company cycles through fresh meat.

## 5. Alternatives 

### 5.1 Be Fast & Flexible

That pretty much covers my take on design sprints. I can see a lot of positives but for myself personally, I guess I'm skeptical of sticking to any one approach and can't stand the idea of a rigid structure that makes an exciting workplace feel like a remedial school.

I think having an eclectic appetite and flexible work style is important in acquiring valuable skills and it's worked out pretty well for me. I haven’t hit any home runs in my career but I'm proud of all the base hits: designing useful things that get acquired, cofounding companies, and going through the world’s most prestigious startup incubator. I like to think that surviving and even thriving in the ever-changing world of tech means I know what I’m doing while also staying hungry for new methods.

I sprinkled some alternatives thoroughout the critiques and it's worth recapping them all in one list. Here's my overall principles of how survive at startups and other demanding environments, all while doing good work and showing design leadership:

* Use an “unprocess”. Pick the right tools at the right time and in a self-sufficient manner, rather than a regimented formal schedule. Think toolbox, not pipeline.
* Understand everyone else’s needs rather than pushing design methods on other people to understand your goals. I.e. practice good user research skills within your own company.
* Avoid groupthink. Don’t shirk hard decisions for the sake of consensus, or you’ll only agree on the lowest common denominator and make Frankenstein designs.
* Keep up team momentum. Work 1-on-1 with various roles and bring the entire team together only in short bursts.

Think of this as my playbook for something I hear designers asking about all the time: how to break out of the artsy kids club and be a grownup at the decision-making table.

### 5.2 Limit Team Meetings To 2 Hours

And for team exercises in particular, I’ve found that the best format to bring everyone together is a long afternoon meeting, regardless of the particular topic or design exercise. It's just long enough to get their best thinking, yet short enough to fit into an otherwise busy week.

> Anything longer than the length of a movie is a corporate group therapy session disguised as real work.

There's probably a biological reason why movies are all 90-120 minutes. It's about how long you can expect a group of people to pay attention to a single topic before they have to get up to eat, use the restroom, or just get on with their day.

So it turns out to be the goldilocks amount for team meetings as well - not too short to rush through things, not too long to melt brains into uselessness.

E.g. for brainstorming, that’s just enough time to clear the air and vent any pent-up ideas before discussing more experimental solutions. For usability tests, it’s enough time to watch a session and discuss the lessons learned afterwards. So on and so forth.

### 5.3 Practice Structured Sketching

On that last point of keeping up momentum while gathering team feedback, sometimes you really do need an all-hands meeting to get the creative juices flowing across various areas of expertise. A designer can't actually do it all alone. 

That’s why I’ve sought out a better approach for collecting design input, something that’s better than a typical brainstorming session with whiteboards and fits with my approach to teamwork on fast teams that I outlined above.

NOTE: [insert a link to Will Evans? something about how I first heard about it from him and it’s worked pretty great in all the years since]

I’m not saying I have all the answers, just that people should try something different if they’ve had similar reservations.

Move pro-sprint section to intro? No! Save it for the end and move the mini sprint out of this article entirely!!!

NOTE: And also bring in and collect my little "mini sprint" teasers into this section instead. E.g. all you really want from a team exercise etc etc etc

If you don’t and you love design sprints, then that’s great! Don’t let me stop you and have fun continuing to practice your craft and learn new skills.

Don’t worry about whether the deliverables are world changing or fix all of your business needs in 5 days; think of it more as a team building exercise that indoctrinates the value of design and familiarizes everyone with the tools of the trade. Teamwork is the ultimate end result because the team will still be there while sprints and other techniques come and go, so use whatever means necessary to wear all the different hats that designers are expected to be comfortable with.

> Another thing they don’t teach you in design school is what you get paid for…
> 
> Mostly, designers get paid to negotiate the difficult terrain of individual egos, expectations, tastes, and aspirations of various individuals in an organization or corporation, against business needs, and constraints of the marketplace…
> 
> Getting a large, diverse group of people to agree on a single new methodology for all of their corporate communications means the designer has to be a strategist, psychiatrist, diplomat, showman, and even a Svengali. The complicated process is worth money. That’s what clients pay for.
> 
> Paula Scher Principal at Pentagram

NOTE: Consider moving Paula’s quote, giving better context, or even eliminating entirely.

But if you’re a designer experiencing any of the problems I described about design sprints — if you find yourself chafing under rigid formats like I did with agile when I was starting out, if you like fast teams but all you want is better design input and don’t want the overhead of a dozen different exercises over the course of a week — you should probably experiment with other methods, techniques that are quicker and more flexible.

Try to mix things up a bit occasionally with things like the mini sprint described below. Block out an afternoon once in a while (let’s say quarterly or so, whenever you feel like there’s pent up demand for brainstorming) and give this exercise a whirl instead to see how it works for you.

## 6. Conclusion 

So that’s my take on an alternative to design sprints for stimulating collective thought. Whether it’s called a mini sprint, design studio, visual brainstorming or just plain sketching, I haven’t seen this exact format discussed much online. That’s a shame, since it’s a a hidden gem and a super unique part of my designer’s toolkit.

Mini sprints are one of my favorite methods for harnessing the best of individual reflective thought, as well as group consensus on important areas to develop. I always come out of one of these sessions with solid design ideas and more importantly, enthusiasm about future projects from the team.

NOTE: Add one last parting shot at design sprints to wrap this sucker up…

## 7. Epilogue
