# Space Exploration Is Important

## This time it's different: reflecting our Earthly challenges instead of ignoring them

This all started with a passionate defence of The Expanse on Facebook, before spiraling out into Lovecraft Country and ultimately the roots of the space program itself.

A few friends had mentioned that although they're fans of The Expanse, it took a few tries to slog through the first season before it clicked for them.

I was agog. How could anyone not be hooked from the very first moment?

Maybe I was so taken in by the world-building that I ignored some other weaker aspects? It's possible. I was also instantly taken in by Raised By Wolves, except I can't think of any weak points there. The lead actress in particular put on an absolute clinic while she crushed the shit out of that role. CRUSHED.

Maybe art takes on different meanings depending on what you bring to it, like if you've been following the impact of technology on society throughout your entire life.

I mean, does anyone wonder what the real world implications are of SpaceXâ€™s rush to Mars colony and Blue Originâ€™s to asteroid mining, not to mention the hundreds (thousands?) of little space startups excitedly watching from the sidelines as those two titans battle it out to build the infrastructure deeper into space like they already did for low earth orbit?

Itâ€™s like weâ€™re watching the railroads to the pacific being built out in real time, one youtube stream at a time. It's utterly fascinating. 

These companies arenâ€™t hypothetical and in the future, they exist right now in the current day. 

For example, just to pick one crazy-sounding one: thereâ€™s a company that doesnâ€™t own any rockets or control their payload, they simply make satellites with tons of little satellites within them and donâ€™t even make the mini satellites, called cubesats, each one no bigger than a shoebox. 

Friend of mine worked at that company and did very well. Now heâ€™s an investor somewhere. 

ASK CHRIS WAKE ABOUT THIS

Actually, cubesats aren't even a company. They're their own ecosystem within the larger ecosystem. Sort of like wifi routers - there are many brands and makers of essentially the same specs. 

Thereâ€™s another company that does make their own mini satellites but no idea who uses them because they rent out time on their sensors by the second. E.g. a satelitte's end user for a few minutes could be some government snooping over military bases and then seconds later itâ€™s a commercial fishery monitoring the open water. 

And thatâ€™s just low earth orbit, in very broad strokes.

What do you think this entire ecosystem of the space industry will do with a permanent moon base? Which is just a gas station on the way to Mars and deeper, which themselves are waypoints toâ€¦ etc.

The more you get into these companies, the more real this stuff is to them. A friend that applied to Blue Origin talks in ways that completely blur the lines between sci-fi and reality. 

And thatâ€™s just the commercial side of things. NASAâ€™s conversations about the Mars colony setting up proper governance, education, and culture are very real and very, very needed, given the track record of exploitation the companies already have on earth. 

My casual armchair quarterback guess is that our solar system will start looking like The Expanse within my lifetime. Long haul truckers will be bringing in precious minerals from asteroids to be processed on the way to Mars or Earth. It'll be as routine as SpaceX's rockets landing back on their launch pads are today.

So yeah, I think The Expanse is a good show. Does that begin to explain why? ðŸ˜‚

A slightly heavier take is that have to care about space exploration because itâ€™s going to happen and ignoring it means exploitation will run rampant to new horrifying heights. No one will be there to check corporate greed. 

Thatâ€™s why everyone against it is asking the wrong question.

Itâ€™s not: should we go into space? No, this isnâ€™t tax-payer funded and dependent on our approval, or even military-driven like the early space race. The private industry has its own momentum now. 

We are going into space and itâ€™s a question of who we want to be as we go. Star Trekâ€™s utopia? Or the Star Wars hellscape. Which universe would you prefer?

Elon even went to the Air Force Academy and said he wants a Starfleet. Iâ€™m guessing thatâ€™s Bezosâ€™ worst nightmare, having to answer to a bunch of uppity entitled cadets.

Branson is playing the clever fool and disguised as a non-factor, written off as just the party guy cheering on the main players. He may be the dark horse in this race.

So the punchline is: we have to care, otherwise we export our exploitation to a rampant level throughout the solar system. I can't help but draw parallels to the way cotton picking machines like the cotton gin were created by an abolitionist to end slavery but sadly instead reinvigorated it and took it to more brutal heights, just as it was dying out.

I hope we break that cycle of human nature as we venture out to the rest of the solar system. The actions we take now may determine whether, just as we grasp the importance of equal rights in new areas like the gig economy or warehouse workers here on Earth, we inflame

Ultimately the person I'm trying to convince is myself. This is a tone poem about diversity in real life making room for my own imagination. 

I'll probably never physically go to space in my lifetime, yet my mind wanders. The more types of people see themselves in space, the more I see myself, even if none of them look like me.
