                                <p>&#8220;Great artists imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil.&#8221;
                                    <em>&mdash; W. H. Davenport Adams, writing about the poet Alfred Tennyson</em></p>
                            </aside>

                            <p><span class="ornamental-first-letter">I</span>&#8217;ve become a pretty good thief over the years. It&#8217;s a subtle art to steal inspiration from various sources and then hide the heist, carefully melding the disparate pieces together to form a unique new thing.</p>

                            <p>That also goes for workflows too, not just designs. I&#8217;ve cobbled together bits and pieces from agile programming, UX design, and disparate fields like movies and entertainment. All in the name of finding what works for me, customized to my unique strengths and working style.</p>

                            <p>What I&#8217;ve ended up with is not a single or fixed design process, but instead a constantly-evolving set of guiding principles and common work patterns.</p>

                            <p>Basically I try to think independently and do good work, fast. And play nicely with others. </p>

                            <p>That&#8217;s about it. Everything else is details.</p>

                            <p>The main tenets of my personal playbook are:</p>

                            <ul>
                            <li>Be flexible. Know your toolbox inside and out, so you can use the right tools at the right time, no matter what the team&#8217;s development process is.</li>
                            <li>Be fast. Momentum is king. Bring a positive and proactive energy to the team.</li>
                            <li>Collaborate well but also think independently. Ingest many viewpoints while still creating opinionated work.</li>
                            <li>Above all, do good work. The final product is the most important thing, all the way down to the smallest detail.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>With all of my emphasis on speed, collaboration, independence and most of all, high quality end results, I guess you could say that these are my version of Dieter Rams&#8217; principles of good design, especially at startups and fast-paced teams.</p>

                            <h3>Be Flexible</h3>

                            <aside class="blockquote">
                                <p>
                                    &ldquo;Specialization is for insects.&rdquo;
                                    <em>&mdash; Robert A. Heinlein</em>
                                </p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>The multifaceted nature of my profession is a perfect fit for my personality because I&#8217;ve always tried to be a master of several trades. Day-to-day, putting those core values to work can take shape in all kinds of different ways:</p>

                            <ul>
                            <li>Trawling through support requests to understand customer needs.</li>
                            <li>Interviewing stakeholders to distill business goals.</li>
                            <li>Doing competitive analysis.</li>
                            <li>Making prototypes to test solutions.</li>
                            <li>Prioritizing feature work.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>And doing countless other things, without having to stop for guidance at every step.</p>

                            <p>To me, product design is a game for fullstack players. UX, UI, prototyping, frontend development, project management, business strategy&#8230; you have to play many positions to win at this game.</p>

                            <aside class="blockquote">
                                <p>&#8220;UX is like Jazz. You need to be an expert musician and understand all the rules before you can break them.</p>
                                <p>Product design is like punk. You need three chords and a 'can do' attitude. Screw the rules (and screw jazz).&#8221;

                            </aside>

                            <h3>Be Fast</h3>

                            <p>It&#8217;s important to attack the work with energy because none of the rest matters if you can&#8217;t pull it all together in fun and positive way.</p>

                            <aside class="blockquote">
                                <p>&#8220;Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.&#8221;
                                    <em>&mdash; It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership, by Colin Powell</em></p>
                                </aside>

                            <p>Enthusiasm for the team and mission can&#8217;t be faked, so I&#8217;m very picky about where I ply my trade. It&#8217;s why I always advise junior designers: do the kind of work that you want to do more of and the rest will follow.</p>

                            <h3>Group Collaboration</h3>

                            <p>There&#8217;s no doubt that creating products is a team effort. Having good relationships and clear communication is particularly important to my style of work, since I have an almost journalistic approach and try to ingest as many different viewpoints as I can.</p>

                            <aside class="blockquote">
                                <p>&#8220;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.&#8221;
                                    <em>&mdash; African proverb</em></p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>Something about double diamond? There&#8217;s a rhythm to group vs solo work. It&#8217;s not easy to ingest as many viewpoints as possible, yet still create opinionated work.</p>

                            <p>Know when it&#8217;s the right time to zoom out to collaborate and zoom in to execute.</p>

                            <p>Collaborate in ways that respect everyone else&#8217;s time. (needs better rewording) Keep up team momentum. Work 1-on–1 with various roles and bring the entire team together only in short bursts.</p>

                            <h3>Independent Thought</h3>

                            <p>Balancing collaborative skills with independent thought and proactive work is where the magic happens.</p>

                            <p>It&#8217;s a particularly important skill for designers to be able to think for themselves because they&#8217;re usually outnumbered by other roles, often by vast amounts. It&#8217;s not uncommon for teams to have ratios as high as one designer per twenty developers, plus an assortment of PM&#8217;s, stakeholders, marketers, and others.</p>

                            <p>The stakes are high - a designer&#8217;s work sets the bar for expected product quality for everyone else. Good design work has an ineffable aspect that sets the tone and injects enthusiasm across all levels of a team. People want to bring good work to life when they&#8217;re excited about the final product.</p>

                            <p>Creating work of a high caliber takes a little bit of solitude, a bit of space where independent critical thinking skills can thrive. Otherwise, you&#8217;re purely reactive and so busy putting out various fires that standards drop just to keep up. Quantity wins over quality and the final product suffers.</p>

                            <p>So avoid groupthink. Think independently and initiate, don&#8217;t just wait and react. Don&#8217;t shirk hard decisions for the sake of consensus, or you&#8217;ll be in a design-by-committee situation and only make Frankenstein designs.</p>

                            <p>Don&#8217;t just take my word for it, look at the science! Groupthink is a common team dynamic and the results are usually inferior to solitary thought by individuals:</p>

                            <aside class="blockquote">
                                <p>&#8220;Decades of research have consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas.&#8221;
                                    <em>&mdash; Groupthink: The brainstorming myth, New Yorker, Jan 30, 2012</em></p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>So collaboration is great and all -don&#8217;t be an asshole because your performance doesn&#8217;t count if you don&#8217;t play well with others - but designers aren&#8217;t hired just to make sure everyone gets along no matter how bad the end result. You&#8217;re there to make great products.</p>

                            <p>That means you need to be comfortable with thinking on your own, initiating your own product direction, and speaking up with candor.</p>

                            <h3>Further Reading</h3>

                            <p>I&#8217;ve written an article called Structured Sketching about one of my favorite techniques for group brainstorming, and also a long form critique on the week-long exercise known as design sprints.</p>

                            <p>So like a business edition of the Rashomon effect, what I’m saying is that “good process” is relative and not everything is a universal truth. This is my own personal take on the role of design in the business world and consider this your warning that I&#8217;m an unreliable narrator in the story that follows...</p>

                            <h3>Agile Is A State Of Mind</h3>

                                <p>Just to state this up front as a disclaimer: I’m not against design sprints, agile development, lean startups, or any other business techniques.</p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>Even waterfall has it&#8217;s place. There&#8217;s a reason it helped organize half a million government employees in the 60&#8217;s for the space program!</p>

                            <h3>Ditches UX Dogma</h3>

                            <p>It's fun to shortcut engineering overhead and jump straight into action. Design sprints upend decades of UX dogma and skip past research techniques that add unnecessary overhead for questionable benefits.</p>

                            <p>From Jonathan Courtney&#8217;s article <em><a href="https://medium.com/p/user-research-is-overrated-6b0fe101d41">User Research is Overrated</a></em>:</p>

                                <p>Up-front user research is a form of product procrastination. It’s busy-work, it’s a way to avoid making hard decisions. It delays the need to make something tangible.</p>

                                <p>It took a while, but eventually [&#8230;] we figured out that even though it was nice to “have the user in mind” when designing, the useful data came from the first user tests, not the research.</p>

                            <p>User interviews, focus groups, personas, empathy maps, mindmapping, ethnographic field studies&#8230; <em>it&#8217;s all a bit much.</em> Especially if you&#8217;re not in a large corporate environment and trying to sell the value of a project before it even starts.</p>

                            <p>Design sprints have clear upsides and it’s easy to see why the practice has such widespread appeal. It’s simple to learn, emphasizes collaboration, and uses testable prototypes to shortcut engineering overhead, all within a specific timeframe.</p>

                            <p>It's become a worldwide phenomenon and you can see the palpable enthusiasm from people trying it for the first time:</p>
