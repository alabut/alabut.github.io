Redesign and refine the twitter app that checks tweets for positive or negative sentiments. Currently the app shows a leaderboard on the main page, splitting the results into two categories.



My initial thought was *"HelloWeather meets Grammarly"* could be an interesting direction.



This was a fun assignment to think about! Partly because I haven't seen many 3rd party Twitter apps since they tightened the reigns on the API a few years ago, which is a shame because the ecosystem used to be a vertible UI playground of interesting ideas.

Which is what led me to my first thought and area of research: weather apps. They've exploded on to the scene recently to become the new UI playground for indie developers, a fertile area of experimentation that's ripe for inspiration. 

The factors that led to this might include Apple's new-ish policy changes to subscription fees and the democratization of the underlying data. However for our purposes, another reason I thought of weather apps are for UI reasons: they're made to easily scan over a range of data by regular people, not data scientists. That could be particularly useful for not just possible leaderboards but also revealing more of the machinery behind the AI itself.

Which led me to Grammarly as another app inspiration, which does that quite well. It also has a pedagogical aspect to it - teaching people what makes for good grammer, not just blindly giving the results - that might be an interesting idea to explore for Vibecheck too. I.e. you could teach people what makes a tweet mean or friendly, maybe even before they compose a tweet and not just scanning other people's results.

So more like an ongoing productivity tool rather than simply a one-time scan of lists.
