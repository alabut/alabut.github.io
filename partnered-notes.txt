Feedback on Partnered case study:

I got a lot of great responses! Ranging from high level about the narrative all the way down to design crits; a mix of positive and negative; and frankly a welcome group of fresh eyes.

Some common themes:

* is this for a PM or a designer? if PM, then ADD METRICS.

“You can make one sentence talking about achievements like: lead the team to Increase revenue by 300% within the first 3 month."

“lastly, some highlighted/bold metrics of success would probably help?  I'm sure most people will be skimming thru as opposed to reading all the text”

* if PM, narrative needs work to prove the results - talk about team process, concrete outcomes, etc. (may have lost some of the “color commentary” by cutting out the intro video)
* if design, then before and after pics might help. Feels like a collection of pretty pixels.
* speaking of pixels, the screenshots are huge and make the page feel super long and possibly overwhelming. Smaller clickable thumbnails might help.
* don’t require people to watch the videos to understand the work.
