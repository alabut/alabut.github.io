Circle Medical is a new kind of full service medical practice that uses technology to deliver a better patient experiences and outcomes at a lower cost. Their iOS and Android apps automate traditionally human-intensive processes such as scheduling, billing and managing medical records.

I worked with them on improving the patient registration and first visit process, which was a fun quick project that hit all the major elements of a project in a short time frame: stakeholder interviews, user research, UX streamlining, and UI polish.

Blending the physical and digital experience, balancing business and user goals, showcasing a design-driven and customer-first approach.

Say something nice about the founders? E.g. I was fortunate that the founders were a designer and customer-centric business guy, something something. Or maybe focus on the company instead of the personalities.

It was clear from the first meeting that Circle Medical takes pride on the level of care provided by their doctors and medical staff, and sees their patient engagement as a differentiator among the flock of startups reinventing primary care. 

So when I came in, my initial mandate was to enhance speed up patient visits by getting more information from them and have them enter their medical records.

Storyline 1: I was asked to cram more info into the onboarding wizard, but found that instead patients and staff were often flustered by the existing check-in process, so instead I proposed that they improve their patient registration and their first office visit by premptively answering the most common questions in advance (e.g. office location) and also by focusing the signup process on SMS and push notifications instead, which should also help with long term engagement.

Storyline 2: I was to investigate the current status of things and the proposed project of getting even more info from patients. 

Challenges? Much like lawyers at a large firm or other experienced experts in their respective field, each doctor had their own idiosyncratic approach to patient interactions and preferences towards how to blend data collection with patient reassurance. For example, some physicians preferred to fill out the medical history themselves while conversing with the patient, since a patients aren't health experts and their own account of their symptoms could often be unreliable. On the other hand, others preferred that the patient fill out as much information in advance as possible, so that the physician could review in advance and then concentrate as much of the time in the office visit to really listening to the patient's story, answering their questions, alleviating their concerns, and generally providing a high level of engagement.

Other challenges... Engineering? Product turnaround time? Hmm, not sure that's as fruitful an area to explore.

How was the project's success measured? I could get creative here and interview George about it, but frankly I barely interacted with him and it was two years ago to boot, plus it ended badly enough that I didn't get the job offer :)
